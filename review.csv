1,RCCP4PH9KE2UB,"I hate being gouged, and I hate weasel word explanations even more","I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since sometime in the 90's (I threw away the floppy disks a long time ago, and I don't recall the earliest date, but it's been a long time.) I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe. No Schedules C, D, or E. In the past, the product was functional, even though the ""Premier"" version provided more help and guidance. That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it. But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing. So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes. Now in the name of ""consistency"" this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something almost twice as expensive. I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be ""consistent"" and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version. Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money. Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we're supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price. Raising the price is something I would object to but it's just a price increase. It's the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it's not possible to give zero stars. Intuit used to be known for making products that pleased customers and surprised them -- in a positive way. It's sad to see the company's current attitude. **UPDATE -- IT'S EVEN WORSE** OK, I'm angry but I need to do a draft of my taxes for planning purposes prior to year end. So I bit my lip and looked at ordering the Premier version. Even in the high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories. I.e. only good for a tiny hobby business, and maybe not even that. So now having forced me to Premier, even that high priced product is useless to me. Intuit, what is wrong with you people? Everyone who reads this: Maybe you will have to buy the product in order to avoid the trouble of converting to another product. But even if you decide to buy it, please take the time to register a negative review here or at other product review sties. You don't have to write as long a review as I did -- just a couple of sentences and click on 1-star. Even if you have a rational reason for giving in to Intuit's extortion, maybe the negative reviews will cause other customers to choose other products. Maybe someday Intuit will be forced to care about customers."
2,R3IG4DXOK3V4RG,"they were all there and the software easily imported my carryover records from the 2013 turbotax file","Although a long time user of turbotax (satisfaction and habit), I have decided it is time to consider alternatives. Unlike many 5-star raters on this blog that seem to think that turbotax is the only alternative to CPAs and retail preparers (like H&R Block offices), there are tax software alternatives available also. Because of habit, satisfaction, and resistance to change I had not evaluated them previously. I contacted Bob, the VP of turbotax, and he advised me that the changes were necessary because ""it was causing problems for 10 million customers at the expense of a very small fraction of the others."" I'm guessing most of us on this blog are apparently a part of this small fraction of others. Considering that people who do not need schedules C, D, E, F, and K-1 probably do not care either way, I think this suggest Intuit hopes to get an additional $300 million revenue (10 million users who apparently care times $30 per upgrade); don't let anyone say it is not about the money/revenue!! But, that is Intuit's business; customers just have to go where they think the value is. So, getting out of past habit, I purchased the 2014 H&R Block Basic software for $19.95 retail. I need Schedules C, D, E, and F; they were all there and the software easily imported my carryover records from the 2013 turbotax file, including depreciation records and carryover values (capital gains and passive losses). I have now completed my pro-forma return and year-end tax review without issue. Bob suggested that they were providing free upgrades to everyone who contacted them; of course, this is for this year only and is probably an attempt to quite the current hoopla. My question is why someone should have to call to get this benefit. Are some customers preferred over others? Further, since you are not likely to get this benefit next year, maybe it is time to bite the bullet and look at other tax software alternatives (not CPAs and tax preparers). I found the H&R Block Basic tax software quite easy to use and it costs a fraction of both turbotax deluxe and premier versions. If you need more handholding you can buy up to premium H&R tax-software versions and at a cost significantly less than turbotax premier. If you do not need handholding, all of the forms are there and do not require manual intervention in order to file your taxes. I conclude that I have probably been oversubscribing to my needs for many years by using turbotax deluxe. I think having to purchase turbotax premier version to get Schedules C, D, E, F moves turbotax out of the acceptable value category; cost is not commensurate with value received and with the available alternatives (actually, I think to get Schedule F, one may have to move to the Home & Business version at even higher cost). But rather than getting mad at Intuit, it's probably just time to move on. If Intuit has 10 million customers that will pay the price of premier (or home & business) turbotax to get basic forms, then there is nothing that a group numbering less than millions is going to achieve by complaining. My guess is that perhaps they may have mis-categorized their customer base and may not have the millions who will pay that premium. But even if they take corrective actions now on this current strategy, I still suggest it is time to move on, as this is the Intuit's second attempt to take away capability under the table; how long before the third time will crop up? In the meantime, if you or friends are going to use turbotax, by all means call and get the free upgrade for this year. Just don't forget to look for your long term solution, as the free upgrade is probably a one-time transitional offer."
3,R3HHDJGEWZ8QL9,"Intuit kisses the corporate blarney stone again","My use of TurboTax would have reached drinking age this year, but I will be ending my relationship with Intuit instead. It has been on the rocks for some time, with the decimation of Quicken for Mac finally forcing me into other software. But I continued to use Turbotax because it was easy, and I had a backlog of files in that program. Changing is always difficult. Throughout my relationship with Intuit, I have been frequently amazed with the arrogant disdain they display for their customers. Over in the reviews for the PC version, Intuit VP Bob Meighan has responded to a number of the 1-star reviews (why can't we give zero stars?) with the drivel that you can still do the commonly needed forms that have been removed from the Deluxe version using the forms method and mailing them in. Mr. Meighan knows perfectly well that people don't buy Turbotax to use forms. He knows that people are buying e-file as part of the cost of the program, and that the method he espouses won't work with e-file. Blarney it is, and blarney it will remain, because Intuit doesn't care about the anger of it's customers. They've been through it before, they've stuck to policies their customers hated, and they still made money. So why bother with a bunch of malcontent customers? UPDATE: I've been pleasantly surprised. I bought the Mac version of the H&R Block Tax Preparation software Deluxe edition download version. A couple of clicks and it was downloaded, a couple more and it was installed, and a final couple to import my 2013 TurboTax info without error. Installation with Turbotax has not always been that easy. One year they had to replace the disk, another year I had to go to a special download location, because the regular one delivered an installer that didn't work. And Hey, Friends, how about this for a bonus? H&R Block's Tax Prep software is significantly cheaper than TurboTax. Of course, you may have a different experience with the install and import, but if you're bothered by Turbotax's 2014 changes, I'd say give H&R Block a try."
4,R2HHZNE4U3J3H1,"TIME TO SWITCH!!! DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE ANY INVESTMENTS!","I almost bought and downloaded, because as a Prime member, Deluxe only costs $40 this year. I have used TurboTax for 15+ years, and the ""Deluxe"" version for the past few years. Then I wondered why all of the negative reviews. The elimination of Schedule D (and I assume Form 8949) from eFile is a major issue for anyone who has and investments. That only 2-4% of Deluxe users fall into this boat simply means that Intuit has been very successful in up-selling past users to the Premier tier. So those 2-4% of remaining low hanging fruit need to be pruned from this version. Funny how last year Deluxe actually imported Cost Basis from my Vanguard and TD accounts. Oh yeah, that is because of IRS rule changes. Bottom-line. InTuit just lost another long term customer. It looks like HR Block imports TurboTax data, so it should be easy enough. Thanks to other Amazon customer for bringing this gouging to light."
5,R3PKLTHHXNM6T6,"Farewell, TurboTax. It was great while it lasted, but it's time to move on.","I remember loading TurboTax for the first time onto my old Packard Bell system's 40 megabyte hard drive from about 13 or 14 floppy disks back in 1995. For the first time in my life, I was actually able to complete my tax return at home on my desktop computer without the assistance of a ""tax professional""! I loved it so much I did it for the next 20 years, up through 2014, without giving any thought at all to switching brands. I recall thinking when competitors such as TaxCut appeared that there was NO WAY I would ever consider leaving my first love. Alas, as in other areas of life, nothing is guaranteed to last forever. I have no interest at all in experimenting with the various ""flavors"" of TurboTax to make sure I'm buying the right one. I have a couple of shares of stock purchased from ""OneShare.com"" that were given to me as gag gifts that occasionally report dividend income. Will ""Deluxe"" handle this? I'm selling a home for which I may or may not need to report capital gains income. Will this require a $30 upgrade? I have no idea, and I'm not interested in taking a chance and finding out I was wrong the hard way. I'm off to a competitor, most likely H&R Block, because it's cheaper, and quite clear what it will allow me to do. Farewell, old friend TurboTax. It was great while it lasted, but it's time to move on."
6,R33M40TYENY1G,"22 Years Down The Drain","22 Years down the drain in one easy step. WOW! First, I thank my fellow reviewers for bringing this to my attention. My wife picked this up as she does every year for me and I am very glad I saw your comments before I opened the package. A quick review of the back of the box and a couple of clicks on the Internet validated all of your comments and reviews and I am grateful. It will be easier to return this since it's unopened and I am done with this product now for good. Last straw. For two decades I have stayed loyal...through the DRM debacle, the doubling of the fee for State e-filing, etc. No more. I refuse to pay NEARLY DOUBLE the price of the Deluxe Software for the functionality of a single simple form (Schedule D in my case) and I refuse to pay one more dime to a company that apparently treats its loyal customers as inept and ignorant chattel to be ground down with the profit boot at their whim and leisure. I think it's safe to assume that Intuit learned nothing from what happened to Netflix, for example. As a former military officer in leadership positions I was often the Income Tax adviser to the soldiers of my unit. I couldn't begin to count the times I recommended this product to soldiers after I assisted them. And it was with a great deal of satisfaction that they would return the following year thanking me for Turbo Tax and no worries about me having to help them from now on. Rather sad and ironic to have to witness the 180 degree shift in this product and my thinking. One more observation I would like to make my fellow reviewers aware of. I read somewhere that Intuit ""made considerable efforts to inform their customer base"" that these changes would be taking place. Really? For the past 12 of these 22 years I would receive an e-mail reminder in mid-December from Intuit that tax time was coming. I could practically set my watch to the date/time group. It usually included a discount for pre-ordering and a summary of the tax law changes and improvements and changes to Turbo Tax. I didn't get one this year...coincidence? Just saying. (And I double checked just now) Anyone else not get theirs too? And Bob, may I call you Bob? Don't bother pasting the form letter response signed by yourself, or one of your overworked flunkies on your behalf, asking me to call. You may call me instead... if you have the guts to admit to me that you ""screwed the pooch"" as we, in the military, affectionately called a self-imposed disaster. And I will be happy to thank you for your honesty, the 21 good years I did have with this product (and they were for the most part), and politely tell you that I will never own or purchase an Intuit product again....ever. Trust is a priceless commodity. Oh, and Bob? I believe the current algorithm for potential sales loss per dissatisfied customer is 1:50 min <> 1:200 max. You have NO idea how networked a crusty, nasty, frustrated, angry, retired Army Chief Warrant Officer is. You may want to revise the max end of that figure. As a last act of loyalty, commensurate with the high regard and sensitivity Intuit has given its customers this year, and with its subsequent and extravagantly thin explanations for doing so, I will take it upon myself tomorrow to educate my 40 co-workers of the changes. I will be happy to enlighten them on Intuit's efforts ""to provide consistent product functionality across our desktop, Online and mobile TurboTax solutions""...and also the associated costs therein...just in case they may have missed the boat. After all, a good taxpayer is a well informed taxpayer. Right? Then I will be informing the other 99.13% of my personal network as well. Half of them are well networked, crusty, nasty, retired Army Chief Warrant Officers too...do the math Intuit, you're very good at that. Sincerely and Regretfully, Brian G. Ames CW3, USA (Ret) PS - I built my first computer in 1976, I have a Degree in Computer Science, I am conversant in 7 programming languages (and 6 others that are dead), I have built over 300 systems and repaired I don't know how many. 35+ years of hardware/software experience. Really Bob, if you are going to answer a customer complaint with IT garbage about cross-platform compatibility and functionality, it should at least be plausibly specific IT garbage about cross-platform compatibility and functionality. You may want to get a little more in depth with your IT people. Regards PS - 9 Jan 2015 Close of Business Day: My wife was able to successfully return the ""Deluxe"" edition. My coworkers were very happy to hear about the changes and those who were TT users were grateful I was able to enlighten them as to COST and EFFECT of the current changes. To a man I believe they are looking elsewhere for their tax software needs. Can't imagine why. Time to start my emails to the rest of my network. PS - 23 Jan 2015: I just read where Intuit will provide a $25 rebate to those filers, as a result of Intuit's ""improvements"", who are forced to upgrade in order to file their taxes as they would have last year with the Deluxe version. A: At least in my area, the rebate doesn't cover the entire cost of the minimum upgrade. So why should I bother when I can have full functionality in another tax software that's $10-15 cheaper than the current Deluxe anyway? And if for some ungodly reason you had to jump one more edition up past that, this would not cover even half that difference. I didn't see anywhere in the article where that was addressed. B: According to a spokesperson at Intuit who announced the rebate, ""We really messed up..."" YA THINK!? On the plus side for Intuit, I believe they will not have to worry about customer awareness of price changes for next tax year. Plenty of publicity now. C: Such a pitiful response to the loyal customers you shafted, it's not even worthy of my contempt. Have H&R now and it imported last year's TT data seamlessly. So far I have found very little difference other than TT has a bit more polish in some areas. I never had a problem with TT itself, wonderful software. My grief is the underhanded way Intuit went about jacking up the prices and the very weak and transparent excuses when they got called out. Update to Intuit Execs: I'm counting coup. As of today I am just short of educating 750 people on the wonderful and thoughtful changes you've made to your Turbo Tax Deluxe product. They are pleased, but you may not be. PS - 2 Feb 2015: My comments regarding Bob Meighan's Manufacturer's Post to this review are below. It is also found in the comments thread for this post as well. Before I paste it I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone for their kind words and also to those who found the review helpful even though they didn't comment. I will not be able to continue to answer specific questions posted here or acknowledge further comments although I sincerely wish to do so. I currently work as a contractor in support of the United States Navy (go figure...lol!) and a support situation has arisen that will require my full time attention for the foreseeable future, even after hours. I may be a Grunt, but by God ALL SERVICE uniforms are important to me, now and always! I stopped counting coup at 1500+ individuals at $49.99 each. I think that I have made my point, especially in light of Intuit's recent actions. God bless you all and God bless the United States and the Armed Forces which protect her. My post as also published in the comments (with some last minute edits): Mr. Bob Meighan, I think I made it plainly clear, but let me reiterate...TRUST IS A PRICELESS COMMODITY! To answer your points, which are obviously a shotgun blast response directed by your CEO (I did watch his insincere, sorry @ss apology video): You have, as of this date (2 Feb), NEVER communicated to me directly as a decades long TT customer about the changes you made to the desktop software product. I KNOW my email is in your database. The message sent back to you was ONLY CLEAR once you saw the belligerent and justified response to your transparent and weak responses affect your public image (and stock standing) and were trumpeted by Forbes, Business Weekly, WSJ, etc. and jumped on by your competitors. 1.) Feb 7...almost 2 months plus after your BS changes were brought to light. Need I say any more? 2.) See my post script dated 23 Jan to my Amazon post. This DOES NOT COVER the TOTAL additional cost of the upgrades. Particularly to the Home and Business version. Do you honestly think we are that blind and can't do simple math? And as far as streamlining the process, I can't comment because I AM NOT USING YOUR PRODUCT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. But I believe there were some concerns by some users about having to submit their SSN etc. You didn't address this at all and I know it was a common concern among those seeking the 'Rebate'. Another fortuitous and convenient oversight on your part? 3.) Too little and too damn late. If you had been genuinely concerned about your decades long customers, of which I am one, you would have never changed the desktop software in the first place. What makes you think that I'm going to grovel to you on hands and knees next year after what you have done to the product I SHOULD HAVE HAD this year? I highly doubt that you will be communicating this to customers, at least directly, as I have yet to see a direct communication from Intuit although you have communicated with me 12 of the last 22 years regarding TT with the exception of this year. I am not holding my breath at all. NO, it was really very easy...very easy to consider a competitor's offerings after seeing what you did and the bogus reasoning and lackluster responses you gave. YES, you are sorry...sorry for the crap you tried to pull, sorry for the BS responses you tried to pawn off on your long time loyal customers and sorry that you were so blinded by greed that you couldn't see the consequences. YES, you should be committed...committed to an insane asylum, because you're crazy if you think you will EVER earn my, or many others, trust again. With my sincere and utter contempt, Brian G. Ames CW3, USA (Ret) PPS - 2 Feb 2015: My bad, I forgot to mention the 5 who did not find my review helpful. Thank you very much for your consideration although it did not meet your expectations. My best wishes to you all. Regards, Brian G. Ames CW3, USA (Ret)"

I can also use the free IRS forms to fill out and mail Schedule D to the IRS. After 15 years as a TurboTax customer, I will be taking my business elsewhere. I recommend everyone else do the same.

10,R1GX9ZAMGWFBGV,"Horrible decision by Intuit to eliminate support for Schedule D ...","Horrible decision by Intuit to eliminate support for Schedule D in the Deluxe version this year. Note to Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax: Suggesting that TurboTax Deluxe does support Schedule D by choosing 'forms mode' and then printing/mailing the hard copy to the IRS is not an acceptable response. Two of the main benefits of using TurboTax are the 'interview mode' and 'filing electronically.' As I'm certain you are aware, sending forms in the mail carries the risk of a lost return and typically delays refunds by up to several weeks. Please reconsider this very poor decision. Thank-you. **Update: The negative reviews have started to hit the newswires.

Sure, you can manually file the Schedule D, but what the heck did I pay for? The Deluxe version clearly says you can file your Fed return electronically--except the actual software says you can't. So, the real answer is if you need to file Schedule D you'll have to pay $30 more as stated in other comments. Alternatively, you can do what I did--which was uninstalled the software, submitted a request for a refund (6-8 weeks!), and started using other software....after using Turbotax for over 20 years. Good job Intuit--you just lost another loyal customer--for life."
12,R3LIKABSRMFY4Y,"Crippled Software and Price Gouging!","Crippled Software!!!!!! Shame on you TurboTax!!! This year's Deluxe and Premier versions are crippled. We would have to buy the Home and Small Business Edition for $50 more. They are useless for those of us who have a small business and stock investments. After almost 20 years of using TurboTax, I just bought H and R Block Deluxe for $29.99 via download from Amazon. It is not crippled and has everything last year's TT Deluxe had and installed/imported perfectly. All my gains/losses are there as well as all the depreciation information from my business. It has five Federal eFiles and includes one state return. Intuit; Just what the heck is wrong with you people?"
13,R1X2TDF85EAPF9,"After purchasing this software on December 4, I imported ...","After purchasing this software on December 4, I imported data from a 2014 tax projection that I had prepared with TurboTax 2013 and prepared both Federal and Virginia 2014 tax returns (using estimated figures where final amounts are not yet available). The Federal return outcome was consistent with my projection but the Virginia state return showed that, instead of a projected refund, I would owe the Virginia Taxation Department nearly $600 dollars! When I checked the state return, line by line, I found that TurboTax was not entering my age deduction of $12,000 automatically as it should have (and as it has done in previous years). I checked the information worksheet data on the returns to ensure that my date-of-birth and age information was correct and found that it was. Having concluded that a glitch in the software must be causing the problem, I attempted to report it to TurboTax but found, to my amazement, that there was no way I could do so. When I finally reached the ""Contact Us"" link, all I got was a blank page! From this frustrating experience I concluded that Turbo Tax is doing all it can to avoid having to interact with customers. Moreover, it seems that the company has let a desire to get the 2014 product out ahead of the competition override quality concerns. I now have no confidence that TurboTax 2014 will produce accurate tax returns and have decided to replace it with another company's tax preparation software. As a result, TurboTax has lost a long-time customer."
14,RKIT52DNK3GYN,"Users Beware of TurboTax's New Design Philosophy: Intuit is In Control, Not You","I have used Mac TurboTax (and its predecessor MacInTax) for over 20 years. Finally, I have been forced to abandon TurboTax completely on account of Intuit's evolving design philosophy to wrest ultimate control of your tax return away from you and force it to look the way they want it to look. Specifically, my complaint is that TurboTax is increasingly limiting the user's ability to OVERRIDE values on the return. In the past -- for many, many years -- a user could override any calculated or transferred value anywhere on the return. But beginning in 2011 and continuing to the present, that ability has become increasingly restricted. As a practical meter, this means that you can't necessarily make your tax return look the way YOU want it to look. Now, Intuit essentially tells you how it HAS to look (if you use their software). At first, limitations on overrides only appeared on Form 8582 (Passive Activities) AND its worksheets. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 I had to prepare Form 8582 and its worksheets with a TYPEWRITER (!!!). But then in 2013, it got even worse when the ""no overrides"" principle was extended to Form 4562 (Depreciation). My federal return makes extensive use of both Form 8582 and Form 4562. These are critical forms and without the ability to complete them the way I want to complete them, I simply can't and won't use the TurboTax program. So I'm done with it. What to do now? In 2013, as an experiment, I purchased and used both TurboTax and H&R Block's Tax Software to prepare my return. Interestingly, the paper return I ended up filing (I always file paper returns) was a mixture of pages from the two programs. The difference between the two programs was huge. H&R Block is what TurboTax used to be: It is intuitive, easy to use, and every entry on every form is totally within control of the user. You can prepare your return to look EXACTLY like you want want it to look -- H&R Block is not looking over your shoulder, so to speak, while you do it. It's also much cheaper, at $35 for the ""Deluxe"" Federal and State version. I will admit that TurboTax is slicker, has a fancier interface, and might cover some unusual tax situations that H&R Block doesn't. (But not in my return, which is pretty complicated as these things go.) But I don't need ""slick."" I need something that will prepare my return the way I want it prepared.... exactly as I want it prepared. If you are an experienced DIY tax return preparer with even a moderately complicated return, you should want the same thing. I would highly recommend anyone to investigate the H&R Block product. For me, it's perfect."
15,R3LV5SIIEGJY2G,"TurboTax Deluxe, brought to us this year by Scrooge","Like so many others here, I was about to purchase TurboTax Deluxe again this year as I have for many years, when I made the same unpleasant and terribly disappointing discovery that many others have reported here. To the VP from TurboTax who said: ""One of the challenges of selling on Amazon (and other sites) is that we don't know who purchases our product so we can't differentiate between new and returning customers like you. We know that some of our customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year. So purchase the product you normally get and then call one of my team members ... so they can get you the upgrade necessary to meet your needs. By the way, if we did this for revenue purposes we would have targeted a segment of our customer base much larger than the 2-4% who are affected by this change."" I say: ""One of the challenges of buying things from your company is that we don't know how and when you will make arbitrary and inexplicable changes to your product for returning customers like us. We now know that you don't care that some of your customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year. We *did* want to purchase the product we normally got - and then actually GET the product that we have normally gotten - without now having to call and beg for it. By the way, why did you target *any* segment of your customer base for this treatment? If not for revenue, then was it just to confuse them, or to annoy them, or to intentionally drive them away?""

With a comment like that form the VP it now makes sense what you guys did) This is just a horrible marketing/revenue ploy ginned up by some clueless circles inside Intuit. Still stunned. Really? Schedule D does not warrant inclusion in the ""Deluxe"" offering? 23 years.... and I am out."
19,R3V6DD8P49KLY7,"Intuit makes Sirius Cybernetics Corp Complaint Division look like amateurs","Just a real-life story here about calling ""Customer Advocate VP"" Bob M's group at Intuit (the 800 number he and his minions keep posting here in the comments section). I have a tiny hobby business, but it requires a real schedule C, not one that's been artificially crippled to choke if you try to enter more than $100 in business expenses. I've always just depended on the TurboTax Basic or Deluxe products to work for me just fine - until now. So, I called he number VP Bob provided (and implied would make me a sooper dooper special deal). The Intuit rep there (""Tim"") said I needed the ""TurboTax Home and Business"" product - which, naturally, is their most expensive consumer version - and that he could offer me a whopping 20% discount on it, making my bottom line $80+tax. When I pointed out that price was well above the Amazon retail (!) of $72.xx, so not a deal at all, he said that was the best he was allowed to do. End of call. So basically, don't bother trying VP Bob's super-secret 800 number expecting a deal that will return you to the way things used to be. Instead, spend $25 or so and buy H&R Block's tax software here on Amazon, which will import your old TT data just fine. You'll save $ and have peace of mind that you're not using software that was lobotomized just to strong-arm you into a more expensive version you never needed before now. You'll also have the satisfaction of not supporting (in Douglas Adams' words from HHGTG) ""some mindless jerks who will be the first up against the wall when the revolution comes"". Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaint Division has nothing on Intuit's Marketing department."

I believe in capitalism, so you do have the right to change your product anyway you see fit, and you have. I have the right to give you my money for that product if I feel it is a good investment. Well, today is the day that it is no longer. Like many here, I have used your product since it came on floppies. Due to the changes in the past few years, I had considered checking out H&R. Today is the day I do. And if it works out fine, I will stick to it (year after year) until they pull some stupid move like this. If they don't, then I enjoy H&R for the rest of my life, and Intuit gets $0 from me,,,forever. I am only but one person so no big deal to you, but I suspect this will not be the case. Now, as to you offer to ""We would love the opportunity to address your concerns""- well, do so!. put out an update and fix the issue. as to ""so we can get you the right product at the right price to meet your needs"" - you had it.. it's called turbo tax deluxe, the un-crippled version.

I use Form entry for many entries, have sold a few stock shares, and have a single K-1 to report. Those simple requirements have been happily supported in the Basic version every year in the past. But those same requirements will require me to move not just to the Deluxe version, but all the way to the Premiere version this year (assuming that I want to e-file). This is just unacceptable, and frankly just not good customer relations. My retired dad has also used TurboTax for 15 years in retirement, and I will encourage him to switch as well.

Will also NOT be buying TurboTax software that does the S-Corporation returns like I have for the past decade. 01/02/2015 - To Mr Meighan, V.P. Of Turbo Tax.

I intend to return the software and purchase H&R block to meet my needs. I also intend to contact Vanguard and my bank who recommends ""Free"" Turbotax and voice my displeasure with Intuit. And don't think Intuit hasn't offended the tax professionals as well. For Lacerte and Proseries, they have required a fast path program which is billed separately, does nothing and is just further proof that the company has no regard for their customers.

Money always goes where it is treated best. Next year, expect either Intuit to correct their mistake or HR Block to follow Intuit's lead. This policy is so unbelievable that it is the first time I have ever reviewed a product on Amazon. I noticed a few years ago that the price jumped from $35 to $50 because they included the e-file as mandatory. They used to charge $15 for the e-file. This was probably mandated by the government as HR Block did the same thing at the same time. One of the IRS's mandates was to reduce costs by encouraging e-filing. After more research, Intuit along with other entities are funneling money to Congress against making the tax code easier and less complicated because that affects their revenue stream. http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/turbotax-maker-funnels-millions-to-lobby-against-easier-tax-returns/ http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2013/04/15/the-tax-complexity-lobby/"
26,RRPXDN2L97VD5,"Crippled Product","There's an old saying: Bulls make money, Bears make money, Pigs get slaughtered. Basically, greed kills. I had been using TurboTax Deluxe for about 20 years. You keep a loyal customer base by keeping a product's functionality consistent, with minor improvements from year to year. It's also a basic axiom is that it is cheaper to retain a customer than obtain a new one. Intuit abandoned this basic premise of customer retention by stripping Turbotax Deluxe of its long standing functionality, and trying (greedily) to force customers into a higher priced product in order to obtain schedules ""C"" ""D"" and other schedules/forms. So, in turn, I have now abandoned Turbotax in favor of H&R Block; which has the forms I want and at a cheaper price. I'm completely happy with my decision, and I intend to stay with H&R in the future. Now, in order to make the same profit, Intuit has to get two new customers; one to make up for losing me, and a second to add market share. This also applies to all the other customers that have abandoned Turbotax for crippling the software. Remember, it costs more to obtain a client than retain one. Bad decision, Intuit. The last thing any company wants to do is to push loyal customers to its competitor, since customers will simply realign their loyalties to the new company -- like now. Update: H&R Block Deluxe works perfectly. Imported Turbotax data flawlessly (seriously, it was perfect). From the time I put the H&R Deluxe disk in my drive, it was 4 1/2 minutes for it to install, load, transfer all of my 2013 turbotax data, and start its interview/personalization process. No glitches. No issues. No problems. Interface is clear and straight forward. It has all the forms I need (just like the old turbo tax deluxe) and was a fraction of the cost that Intuit wanted for the product that would have given me the same forms. Unless they do something foolish, H&R Block gets my future business. Update 2: Several reviewers have indicated that they wanted to return their turbotax CD, but their local vendor would not take back an opened software product. Turbotax will refund your money, and you can then buy H&R Block or some other softwware cheaper. Here is the link to the turbotax guarantee: https://turbotax.intuit.com/corp/license/desktop.jsp About 2/3 the way down, you will find: ""Satisfaction Guaranteed (or Guaranteed Easy).

It's one thing to raise the price of your product and let it compete in the market place. It is completely different to dumb down your product and sell it as the same thing. Whoever thought of this marketing scheme is an idiot and should be fired.

I'm a fairly typical, middle class dude who has stock profits and losses and I also have a small business in addition to my full-time job. For many years TurboTax Deluxe was perfect. Now it just sucks. INTUIT, here's a message from a TurboTax user of many, many years. I will NOT pay double what I used to pay so that I can file my Schedule C. You have lost a customer. Apparently you have lost THOUSANDS of customers. Good, that's exactly how Capitalism and the free market are supposed to work. I can tell from your user forums and from reviews here on Amazon that your customer service and support agents have been working long hours replying to the complaints. Oh, regarding those user forums on your web site... Have a good time finding and deleting the 30 or 40 entries I made suggesting to every person who posted a question about the Deluxe downgrade that they should come to amazon.com and buy H&R Block Premier. Like others, I don't care one tiny little bit what your reasons are. Don't even bother telling me the reasons. In fact, shut up and listen carefully: I am going to buy H&R Block Tax Software this year for just about 1/2 of the price I'd have to pay for the higher version of TurboTax. I've never used it before, but if I like it then I will *never* consider switching back to TurboTax. Lucky you, you now have one fewer pesky customers to fatten your bottom line. If I don't particularly care for H&R Block then I will re-consider TurboTax next year if you reverse the damage that you did this year. H&R Block Tax Software advertises that they can import returns from last year's TurboTax. I can spend $42 for H&R Block Tax Software Premium and get the same functionality I get from TurboTax Home & Business at a cost of $80 (amazon.com prices). I choose H&R Block Tax Software Premium."

If I wanted to do that I wouldn't buy any software package. Bob Meighan's (Intuit VP) explanation is pure bull. A way to force you to a higher priced version.

UPDATE 12-17-14 Just installed H&R Block Deluxe - easy to activate - excellent user interface - imported last year's Turbotax file perfectly - so far so good.

34,R1VOIKLFCUAAM2,"Forget it Bob - Comment from a Year-1 Customer","So I think Bob Meighan, VP of TurboTax, is going to get the message this year, and it's going to be costly. This decision to disable forms will rank up there with the great decision Novell made after they bought WordPerfect, and decided to stop offering free tech support to the government. The result was that Uncle Sam switched over to Microsoft, and the government has never looked back. The same will now happen to TurboTax. Now Bob, it's BAD ENOUGH that your company managed to kill off the free state tax preparation software offered in the Commonwealth of Virginia, forcing millions of taxpayers in this state to move up to your ""Deluxe"" Federal/State edition. Maintaining that free service cost the state taxpayers a total of about $80K, compared to the millions they now must spend to purchase upgraded versions of your software because the state - thanks to efforts engineered by your company - shut down the service. But now you intend to force me to pay more again? Well simply put, I'm not going to do it. I have used TurboTax to file my taxes since your company started offering the software to the public - I'm part of your original customer base from the very beginning. I am here to officially report to you that I am now going to switch to another tax preparation software. Due to the painful process of making this conversion, I'll also mention that I have no intention of coming back to TurboTax software. Apologizing after the fact, and providing explanations about how painful your decision was to charge us more money is a lame excuse unfitting of a corporate executive. Given that TurboTax has been around many, many years, I must assume your corporation has been profitable over the years. That simply demonstrates that your current move to force people to upscale is nothing more than a profit driven move to charge us more money. You can explain away all you want, but we (including your loyal customer base) have the final judgment on your grand business scheme to charge us more money. Well, we'll see how many profits you make after this tax year, because it's my sense a lot of people are going to go somewhere else - including me. Next year, when you look at your profit/loss statements and recognize this profound mistake, get rid of the great brains in your corporation who originally came up with this ""grand idea"" (which might also include you), and start sending me passionate appeals to ""come back home"" to TurboTax, I will take distinct pleasure in depositing your mail in my round file. You guys really blew it, and it's time for me to move on. Good luck."
35,R1DRNZBR7XPOKJ,"TurboTax removes important schedules C and D from Deluxe version without warning.","TurboTax. You must be crazy removing Sched C and D from Deluxe. I have used TurboTax forever. I am shocked that you decided to screw your loyal customers like this and that you failed put a prominent warning on the box informing potential buyers that these commonly used schedules have been removed. I for one will never use another Intuit product unless you reverse this decision promptly. If I do not hear such an announcement soon, I will purchase a competing product."
36,R3VQY13Z0Q1Z9O,"Good Riddance!","I've been using TurboTax exclusively since it came on floppy discs and was produced by ChipSoft. Just now, I nostalgically have in my hands the three 5 1/4 and two 3 1/2 floppies that came with the 1992 tax year package (yes, both size floppies, since the 3 1/2 hadn't yet become industry standard). These ran on Windows 3.1. I've recommended TT widely to friends and associates, and until lately have been satisfied with the product. My return requires Schedules A, C, D, F, K-1, various depreciation schedules, itemized deductions, etc. -- you get the picture. Until this year, TT BASIC (yes lowly Basic) was adequate for a knowledgeable user. I wouldn't have minded too much to move up to TT Deluxe for these features (that's why I'm posting here), but as so many helpful readers have noted, even TT Premier wouldn't be adequate for me; I'd have to buy TT ""Home and Business"" to Efile my return. As if that isn't bad enough, the absolutely clueless and insulting statements by Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, and his staff was the deciding factor in resolving to look elsewhere. Collectively, these are a slap in the face of a good friend and strong supporter! I'm giving TurboTax Deluxe one star only because zero stars is not an option. One could see this coming, first with malware customer tracking installed a few years back that embarrassed TT ultimately apologized for, then taking away free efile, ultimately restoring and apologizing for that -- always pushing a little too far, then apologizing, but always sneakily trying to put one over on their loyal customers. Even if all the bad press persuades TT to 'repent', as long as the current management prevails, we can only expect more of the same dirty tricks. Readers that don't have a firewall or router that enables them to monitor and track internet connections may not know that for the last several years as TurboTax is started a check box asking permission to connect to the internet appears. Despite being EXPLICITLY DENIED permission, a few minutes later the program surreptitiously attempts to connect anyway! This greedy company is untrustworthy as well. Since putting off this year's tax prep purchase, I've been deluged with TT email 'money off' solicitations, a tie in with prime subscriber's discounts, offers by TT to free upgrade previous customers that bought the 'wrong' package based on their previous experience, etc., but based on past performance and the sneaky and snarky way this year's offering has developed, appeasement offers will be only a prelude to major abuse next year. Intuit (TurboTax) management intent should be very clear by now: customers are going to pay a lot more -- if not this year, then next. All of the contributors to these reviews that are hoping/wishing that TT will reconsider are just postponing the inevitable. Don't they realize they're on the slippery slope, and that a little discount here and an upgrade there are only steps to condition to even bigger changes in the future? There is only one way to effectively address this situation, and that is by buying a competitor's product. Loss of sales to their main competitor this year and next is the only thing that will really get Intuit's attention (as if I still cared). As a co-owner of a small high technology corporation, I write with assurance that keeping loyal, satisfied customers is much easier than getting new ones. But, this is Intuit's decision and business plan, and for all we know it's going exactly as planned. I'd wager that it's well thought out, probably supported by a substantial study by an outside firm, and that loyal customer outrage is expected, quantified and judged tolerable. I suspect that they are gambling that we'll pay the price because we're anxious about changing; they couldn't care less about whether you'll like it and whether you've been a loyal customer for decades (their scripted crocodile tears and free upgrade offers for those who call in should be evidence enough). At this point, Intuit could give me free ""Home and Business"" and I wouldn't use it. I bought ""Block Financial H&R Block Tax Software 14 Premium + State"" from Amazon via prime, and expect to receive it later today. Whatever the problems installing, learning and using may be, I'll work through them (I'll write about my experiences there). With my purchase, Block will be marginally strengthened and may be even more competitive next year. My company uses Intuit's QuickBooks and my wife uses Quicken for her home office; I'm going to find alternatives for these as well. I'm through with TurboTax, and all the games they've played. Just one person, but I'm on a mission, and I feel really great taking this action! Good riddance!."

I'm taking H&R Block's offer: Block is offering dissatisfied TurboTax customers a free download of its Deluxe software, which normally sells for $44.95 and still allows E-filing of Schedules D and C. Gene King, Blockâs director of communications, says TurboTax purchasers should send an email to SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com containing their name, email and phone number; whether they use a Windows or MAC operating system; and a scan of their store receipt for TurboTax or a copy of the email showing their TurboTax download code. In return, theyâll be sent a link good for one free download of H&R Block Deluxe + State. (Data youâve entered in last yearâs or this yearâs version of TurboTax should be transferable.)"

Without the reviews, as many have said, I would have automatically ordered TT and suffered the consequences. Sadly Intuit is operating under the false assumption that ""we are the smartest people in the world"" mentality and we are only doing what is best for you (our customer) so suck it up. This seems to be moving not only through our government's mind set, but in the private sector as well. At least in the private sector, we have other options and with over 1000 one star ratings, we are exercising those options in force. Intuit is operating under two rules it seems. Rule 1: We don't make mistakes. Rule 2 : When we do make a mistake, see Rule 1. So far my experiences with H&R Block software has been great. Data transferred over from prior years turbo tax with no issues and data input has been as expected and straight forward.

But for more than 20-years now I've continued to use their tax product, not out of loyalty, but simply because it was easier to just continue down that familiar path. However, Intuit's recent ill-conceived business decision to severely downgrade the feature set of an established product is a game changer - it can't be ignored. To continue marketing it under the same name is just unforgivable. Yet they claim this change is to help minimize confusion? Really? Isn't the very nature of this kind of shell game shenanigans with product features the very essence of creating confusion? And when you combine this with the annoying habit they have of making unnecessary user interface changes it's just too much to expect my continued complacency. Come on Intuit... own up to it - you've become overly greedy. This is just the latest installment in a long line of feature downgrades across the years all designed to ratchet up your average ticket price. Maybe it'll work again this time for your bottom line and your bonus, but it won't work for me anymore - I'm done. This is the final straw and I will gladly switch to any competitor's product that adequately meets my needs - there appear to be quite a few.

I was about to purchase it when I read the reviews and found out that Schedule D is not included in the Deluxe version. This is outrageous and amounts to price gouging. People should not have to pay astronomical amounts of money to file their taxes. Even though the Schedule D form is available, as stated, in the Deluxe version what idiot would want to mail a paper return? This is absurd and ridiculous. People purchase software because they want ease of use and electronic filing. I don't buy the excuses and the pleas that Turbotax has made some sort of sacrifice. This company acts like it is doing customers a favor. I guess the loss of customers will have to speak for itself. Turbotax should heed the comments posted here. Many of the posts have come from long-time customers who have said they will choose a competitor's product.

I have been a loyal customer since the early 1990's and have provided the capital and feedback to help Inituit evolve. They have made mistakes along the way, but this one calls for mutiny. Like me, everyday citizens do productive things, like start a small business, buy & sell assets for capital gains, rent property, are part of a partnership, or run a small farm. In many cases, these are startups or very small transactions, not worthy of hiring accountants or even using super-premium software to go through undue complexity to file taxes. Intuit apparently sees people like us as easy targets for additional revenue to meet their goals. We must send a message that we have options. I will be filing this year using a competitive product, regardless of whatever weasel words Intuit management may provide.

Take a look at your Amazon ratings--they foretell a need for you to get your CVs ready for the unemployment office. Recommendation to Intuit shareholders, SELL NOW before the earnings hit affects the market. Sentiment is clear on this. I will be recording my Intuit short sale using someone else's software. For those of you left holding the bag after the stock drops, attend the annual shareholder meeting and demand the board clean house. New management is in order. http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2015/01/09/irate-turbotax-users-can-get-free-upgrades-or-block-substitute/?partner=yahootix http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing"
42,R3FWV2YLC9I1RM,"Schedules removed from e-filing - ridiculous excuses for corp greed.","Like many others here, I too have been a long time user of this software, both for myself and for extended family. After some discussion over the Christmas celebration, our patronage now comes to an end - and that applies not only for myself but all of my extended family. I can almost understand removing Schedule C from electronic filing, albeit with some exasperation as it will effect many who are not primarily small business owners but received a 1099 and require a Schedule C for the most minimal of income, but removing Schedule D from electronic filing as well is ridiculous. Yes you can file manually, and will be waiting for extended periods for refunds as a result, and hey, if you're going to manually file Schedule D or C, you might as well just download all the forms from IRS and manually file them and save yourself giving any money to Intuit. I can respect honesty - if Intuit admitted they wanted more money, that is one thing - but the bs excuses are beyond contempt. Good bye TurboTax. edit on 01/02/2015 : I just logged into Amazon and see H&R Block Deluxe for $21.99. Yes, $21.99!!!! The same feature set from TurboTax (their Premier version) is currently $89.99. That's a 410% markup by Intuit over H&R Block's software. Seriously. Can there be any doubt this is not about greed now? Needless to say I've just purchased & downloaded H&R Block Deluxe. I am emailing the rest of my extended family to logon and grab it right now while it is at this price."
43,R2UG2GN2P4YMKC,"20+ Year Dedicated Customer Switching Due to Horrible Marketing Decisions","I have used TurboTax since the 1990s for every year even after some really stupid decisions such as removing the included filing and charging for state separately(which were corrected in past versions after the release). I understand the need for a business to grow and make money, so even when it came to light that the company was lobbying against free free filing I was not phased since that is direct competition to thire way of doing business. So, why am I rating the software that I have used for the last 20+ years so low? It is all in the features provided in that software being removed and increasing the price I need to pay for those features compared to the competition. This is yet another PR nightmare for the company who refuses to listen to their customers, so I feel the need to not only vote with my wallet, but to post this review. What Bob Meighan fails to understand is their competitors not only are offering the same solution at the same price, but they are capitalizing on their PR nightmare by offering discounts. Intuit per normal policy digs their heels in and stand by their poor decisions while some of their most loyal customers leave in droves. This is due to an analysis that they can make more money and only piss off a small portion of their customer base. Well, by the time they realize the tragedy and scale of their mistake it will be too late. They should have done something to address this issue before 1/1 aside from PR spin."
44,RFH6NSJ4E2GYT,"Avoid TTDeluxe unless ability to efile a return with Sch D is restored","Bad decision by Intuit. I've used TTDeluxe for about 20 years; I will go with a competitor if ability to efile a return with Sch D in TT Deluxe version is not restored by mid-January. TT website: ""We've made some changes to TurboTax this year to give you the best possible experience for your tax needs."" Who are they trying to kid???"
45,R2OID8SLXTPNCJ,"I am certainly glad I checked the reviews before downloading Deluxe","I am certainly glad I checked the reviews before downloading Turbo Tax Deluxe. I almost did it reflexively since I have used TurboTax since I first started using a computer for tax preparation many years ago. But this year I will compare other software before deciding which to use. Like many other customers, I am offended not only by what is essentially a considerable price increase (when you have to pay more to get what you used to get for less, it IS a price increase) but also by the hypocritical and disrespectful responses from the company's VP. When a company starts to disrespect its customer base, it is on the downward slope and deserves it. Update: After reading the reviews for the H&R Block deluxe software, I ordered it through Amazon at less than half what the TT Premium would have been. Too early to say how it will actually work but the reviews of other customers make me optimistic. I hope Turbo Tax learns a lesson from this debacle. By the way, is that where Dilbert works? Their VP's comments remind me of his pointy haired boss.:)"
46,R2C65B6PT5TWVC,"2014 - Anything BUT TurboTax","I have been using TurboTax for so many years now that I can't remember filing on paper forms. Generally, I've been pleased. Over the last couple of years though I will admit that the program has taken a turn for the worse - making it appreciably more difficult to use. Among others, my primary complaint centers around the unbelievable complex manner in which we must manually enter stock transactions. We used to be able to enter data directly onto Schedule D. It was either last year, or the year before, they blocked direct access to Schedule D and forced us to enter info via the clunky and difficult 1099-B worksheet process. Instead of entering information on a single transaction in fields spanning left to right across the screen, they now make us move up and down the screen. Although that does not sound like a huge change, it is MASSIVE. It makes entering the data extraordinarily difficult. It's hard to navigate the form and doubly hard to keep track of where you are in data entry. I was so mad about this change that I swore I would look into other alternatives for tax prep software. With the 2014 filing season, it appears that TurboTax has put the nail the coffin of being my go to tax prep package. I am aghast at the reviews I am reading here. Uniformly, they are negative. On that front, they are consistent. However, I can no longer determine which of the many packages I must now buy to fit my needs. It appears that TurboTax has limited access to Forms C, D, and E in the Deluxe ($49) version. I use all 3 forms. However, I can no longer tell which version I must buy to gain access to these forms. Some reviewers indicate that Premier ($69) will work. Others indicate that, no, one must purchase Home and Business ($79). And even the hapless TurbTax Executive who posts here, answering user complaints, is presenting conflicting information. ENOUGH. Given what I encountered with data entry for stock transactions last year, what I'm seeing with the massive uproar from the user community here, and overall confusion as to what package is necessary for what forms, I have made up my mind for 2014 .... ANYTHING BUT TURBOTAX."
47,R1JGJ46REQZWJT,"I have read the Intuit explanation of why schedule D ...","I have read the Intuit explanation of why schedule D is no longer on TurboTax deluxe. But what I fail to see is an understanding from Intuit that TurboTax customers have been customers probably out of loyalty. There are many more products out there, compared to when many of us starting using TurboTax when it was available only as a 3.5 in floppy disk. We purchased many years out of brand loyalty, and then with very little announcement of change, schedule D is no longer on Deluxe. OK Intuit, you are justifying the change, it get it. You are also explaining that we should have read the bullet points. OK. I read it now, and I'll remember it next year. But next year it won't be with Intuit."
48,RIOLXPGAP526O,"The end of Turbo Tax for me","Bye bye to Turbo Tax. I have used this software for the past 13 years. I have been happy with TT Deluxe and never had a problem with it. However, this year's version, which has been watered down by the elimination of critical schedules is no longer suitable for my needs. However it is the manner in which Intuit has chosen to screw its users by not alerting them loudly to that fact that has turned me now to H&R Block Deluxe software. Intuit has always had the rep of being sleazy marketers, but this latest ripoff is the last straw. Based on the H&R reviews, their software does the job just fine at a huge cost savings over the TTPremier version. Disguising a price increase is the highest insult a company can pay to a loyal customer."
49,R2TLHAAN1R2OM8,"Too many losses over too many years","I am very sorry to see the loss of support for schedule D in the Deluxe edition. I've been using TurboTax every year since 1986. I'm afraid I've finally reached the breaking point and will have to switch products. From my standpoint, TurboTax has been slowly degrading its capability over the years. I know my issues don't affect everyone, but they do affect me: The latest - loss of Schedule D (all the explanations are really B.S. It is just a price rise.) Prices jumping significantly with no increase in functionality - especially in times of low inflation. Earlier - loss of Schedule C (although I no longer use it every year) Dumbing down the user interface. I used to primarily use Forms view when it gave all the built-in help when needed. Now you pretty much have to use the Q&A view to get help and it's not always immediately obvious what forms are being updated. Much earlier - loss of ability to enter receipts for the following year as you got them and have them all picked up along with the previous year's tax return when you purchased the new version. Update 12/29/14: OK, I admit to overreacting a bit. Most of that was the result of the ""claim"" that this wasn't a price hike. I still like TurboTax and have usually rated in 5 stars. I still can't do that this year because of the price hike and the way it was handled. However, at least for this year, the offer of a free upgrade to Premium does cover the pain. So, I'm raising my review from 1 star to 3 stars. I know I'll have to buy Premium next year so I may be disappointed then, but I won't be unpleasantly surprised again. Price hikes do occur, and while I'm never happy, I understand that they do."
50,R3N3Q96ORYARKI,"Forward to H&R Block","A while ago H&R Block sent me a copy free to try. Since I had already purchased TT, I compared the two. H&R Block software was just as easy to use and provided the same level of deductions. It easily incorporated prior years taxes from TT. I used H&R Block for a couple of years until TT noticed I wasn't a customer and offered me a good deal. Sorry I switched back. Thanks to all the reviewers for pointing out the new limitations disguised as enhancements. As they've stated, previous versions of the product that I've used for decades have been crippled requiring me to upgrade to a much more expensive version. Forward to H&R Block"
51,R14MT5HO7VOIQ0,"Turbotax and Quicken used to be the best","Woooow - what is the story with Intuit. I read reviews of both Turbotax and Quicken only to see loads of one star reviews.

Not 1 star products. Come on Intuit"
52,ROYKKMSDISO6C,"many TT users have switched and found it just as good, and it will import from my TT files","I have been using TT since the 80s - probably the 2nd or 3rd year it existed. I had to hand enter the numbers onto the IRS forms back then. I have been it change and mature. I have been using the deluxe version since it was first offered. Now, it seems I cannot use this one anymore, and they want to force me to the premier version. Nope. Their reason for doing this makes no sense at all. I am switching to H&R block. If you read the reviews, many TT users have switched and found it just as good, and it will import from my TT files."
53,RKVLUSOXMWZCA,"Dropping Schedule D is dropping Turbo Tax for me","Dropping schedule D from deluxe? That is a brain dead move, been using Turbo Tax for over 20 years. It ends with 2013 tax year, 2014 will be with H&R Block tax software. As for the VP arrogant comment ""Just so you and others know, we have not raised the price of the TurboTax 1040 products since 2005. That's a fact."" Stick your facts up your a$$ liar. I use to have to buy another state and that cost has about doubled. That is a price increase. That's the fact. Just remember all these loyal customers that have been with you 10-20+ years that are leaving are leaving with a bad taste in their mouth and will never come back. I have heard good things about the H&R product"
54,R3AGK9LMHYCFII,"TurboTax Deluxe 2014 - useless for even small investors","As has been posted by many others, TurboTax Deluxe no longer supports step-by-step data entry mode or e-filing of Schedules C, D, E, F, and K-1. Instead of simply and modestly increasing the price of Deluxe, which most users would accept, Intuit has instead quietly decreased important functionality of Deluxe, requiring an upgrade to Premiere to regain the missing functions. The need for the upgrade may not be apparent until much of a return has already been prepared, creating a strong-arm incentive for the user to spend another $20 for the upgrade. I, like other long-time users, am appalled at Intuit's marketing strategy, and have decided to vote with my wallet. TurboTax has lost a loyal, long-time (20+ years) user, and H&R Block has gained a new customer. So far, I like H&R Block's product, and suggest that others who are similarly dismayed with Intuit's tactics give it a try."
55,RF2FUK3MIRBNH,"Intuit demonstrates the worst of corporate greed","As a loyal customer of TurboTax for many years, I think it's awful that Intuit is dropping functionality in its TurboTax Deluxe 2014 software this year, especially support for Schedule D. No matter what pretext they use to justify this action, it's obvious that it's all about money to them. By forcing a high percentage of their previously satisfied Deluxe customers to pay an additional $30 to upgrade to the Premier product, they're exploiting a weakness of human nature-- fear of and resistance to change-- and demonstrating the worst of human nature themselves: Greed. The sad part is that they will almost surely increase revenue this year. Bad behavior gets rewarded yet again. H&R Block Deluxe claims to be able to import Turbo Tax files from previous years, and appears to have a good reputation, including continuing support for Schedule D in 2014 tax year version. At over 60% less expense than TurboTax Premier, it is worth exploring, and I am purchasing it instead of TurboTax. If I run into problems, I will update this review to that effect. I would encourage others to explore alternatives to Intuit's software, as negative feedback in this case may be the only way to effect positive changes."
56,R3PIELK6KQDL7B,"Virtually Worthless","I erred in buying this, thinking it was just like the last many years. This is a completely different and basically worthless product for ANYONE who needed the deluxe version to work as it has in the past. This item is extremely basic at best. I just ordered the H&R Block Deluxe version. It is way cheaper than Turbo Tax ($30 new on Ebay, delivered). It covers Schedules C and D, while the Turbo Deluxe does neither. Plus, it can grab the Turbo Tax files. After many, many years with Turbo Tax I left them because they cut 50% of the functionality out of their Deluxe version without publicizing it. No one should buy from Intuit after this screw up."
57,R1I4M131PUGR8O,"Intuit, I think you will be getting a pretty strong message this year.","I am writing a review because I have used TurboTax for years and years. I loved the program, the ease of use and even with some steady increases in price, I was OK with the cost. After reading the comments, however, I will no longer be using TurboTax. Anyone reading this who urged others not to buy it - here is your first convert. I remember way back when when QuickBooks was super cheap and Intuit was a miracle because of the cost factor. Capitalism is great, but eventually due to the requirement of shareholder returns, greed trumps customer concerns. At that point, consumers must vote with their pocketbooks. I am now voting with mine. My next stop after writing this review is to go to other return provider's websites. Thank you, Intuit, for making me feel powerful in my ability to send a consumer message. Also, as an aside, the fees charged for optional services, such as alternative ways to make payments or receive return funds are ABSURD."
58,R3E0KH3KPDXEL4,"Things like this make my blood boil.","They know. They KNOW that people buying Deluxe for years will buy it again without reading the proverbial fine print. Then the customer gets to the key point in the program, and it says ""GOTCHA!!! We GOTCHA!!! Pony up another thirty bucks or you're out of business!"" ""What's that? You didn't notice that the product has ""changed""? Well, shame on you for being so careless, tsk tsk..."" Am I clueless and hopelessly out of touch by having an expectation that I should be treated honestly and fairly? Every day you have to watch for companies trying to get over on you. Go to the supermarket: A pint of Haagen Dazs is now 14 ounces but of course the container size is the same as before. (Wouldn't want the customer to notice.) File an insurance claim, it's unfairly rejected. (Maybe the insured won't notice or care or bother to fight, so it's more profitable this way). Buy Turbo Deluxe as usual - Oops, GOTCHA! Hey Mr. Meighan - Who do you think you're kidding? When you insult my intelligence, you insult me. You insult all of us. Newsflash: Businesses are successful when they treat their customers with honesty and respect. Things go south in a hurry when you go for the cheap buck by deceiving - no, cheating your customers out of their money. Did I mention I'm a tax professional? Wait till I put the word out on this! ."
59,R1PACISQWDNH4P,"Meighan is wrong, you can't paper file Using Deluxe with Schedule D..","Bob Meighan, TurboTax VP, said ""As I've mentioned in many other places, you are NOT required to upgrade to Premier. You can still use forms mode to complete Schedule D and print/mail your return to the IRS."" That doesn't seem to be true. Based on that I bought TurboTax Deluxe. But when you try to print Schedule D it says form ""Not Done"" and the print has a large ""DO NOT FILE"" banner across it. Nor does it display the checks that tell you why the form is not done. So you really can't do a paper file."
60,R2RXU3TYU6FEAE,"TT Deluxe not what it used to be.","Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing but I've used the deluxe version for years without issue so why should I expect problems? I have a small business and never had any problems with completing Schedule C in the past. But now it seems Sch C is limited in the deluxe version to businesses with less than $100 in expenses so its useless if you have a real business. Now it looks like I'll have to upgrade to home and business if I want to use TT this year. Or maybe now's the time to abandon TT for something else. Way to support your long-term customer base Intuit! Update: Ended up going with the H&R Deluxe. Cheaper, easy import of old TT file and easy transition. A little clunckier when it comes to printing/saving files but end product is the same. Intuit got my $ this year but no more. I'm done with TT, Quicken, and QuickBooks."

We were recently informed we could get a $25 refund AFTER FILING if we met certain criteria, filled out a form, and then waited for the folks at Intuit to provide a refund. REALLY??? THAT IS YOUR SOLUTION???? ANY OTHER ACTION THAN UPDATING THE DELUXE VERSION TO INCLUDE THE MISSING SUPPORT, AND REFUNDING THOSE WHO WERE FORCED TO PAY AN UPGRADE FEE DUE TO YOUR BAIT AND SWITCH IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! I am extremely disappointed in the leadership, this is an obvious lack of vision and will result in catastrophic consequences for Turbo Tax as a product. Needless to say after a decade of using turbo tax I will be using other products moving forward."

We file a simple return with a sch C.. The Sch C shows $400 minus office expense. The Intuit website says that you can do a simple Sch C using the basic home deluxe which costs the same as last year. It will not let you fill in a single line, and locks up to a page asking you to buy an upgrade. I called Turbo Tax on it as it does not match their advertising, spent 20 minutes on the phone> They said sorry, we wil l fix that, and upgraded it to Premier. Well, guess what - Premier won't do a one line Sch C either. Now I have to spend another 1/2 hour on the phone trying to resolve this again. I could see them asking a little extra for a complex schedule C but really - they get money for the software, then then get money for the E-file, then they get money for a new Quicken every year, and now they want $40 for one of the simplest forms one can have? We are done with this product."

And Mr. Meighan, what's the deal encouraging people to contact you so you can discuss how TT can keep you as a customer? It's obvious how you can keep everyone as a customer...........undue this deception. You also didn't make it clear that using the forms (manually) will override the audits and checking portions.

I am sure they believe, ""yes peopel will be made, but if they use service like H&R block or tohers cost is still higher"". That might be and perhaps you do not have much competition now. But I am like all of the other horrible reviews here. I woudl rather spend $200 or $300 with another company or service then give these crocks one dollar of my money. Terrible business decision.

The TurboTax rep has said that the change was done in service of product consistency. Maybe, maybe not...but ultimately, it is an irrelevant point. What is relevant is that the change was done at the expense of their customers. If TurboTax was so inclined, I'm sure they could have found a way to establish product consistency without crippling their alleged ""Deluxe"" product and creating a ""bait and switch"" scenario for many of their customers. For informed customers, this change is clearly infuriating, based on the responses on Amazon. The next wave will come from customers who pick it up in the store assuming they are getting the same functionality as in the past and getting an unpleasant surprise...I would not like to be a customer service rep at Intuit right now! I believe in Karma, and I believe that the Intuit executives who made this greed-based decision are going to experience it. I believe that this latest ploy is going to push many TurboTax users to look for alternatives, which will open the market for other companies to establish a stronger foothold and hopefully remove TurboTax's dominance in this market.

Like most people that have used this product for years, I went straight to the product level that I would usually purchase based on my tax situation - which is the Deluxe level. Unfortunately, I am also one of the 2-4% of Intuit's Turbotax customers affected by this change. Like many that have posted, I have been a long-term user of the TurboTax products all the way back to the days of large packages of floppy discs where the first night's tax prep activity was just loading the software. As part of my regular job I interact with electronics vendors/sales teams almost daily. I've found that direct feedback is sometimes beneficial at the sales level but rarely helpful at the executive level within the companies I dialog with. In 25 years in the electronics industry, I've never seen an executive that made a wrong decision regardless of the amount of negative feedback from customers. Even so, I will summarize my thoughts... - While the feature-set of the TurboTax tiers may have been rearranged to be more consistent within the TurboTax portfolio (online, mobile, etc.), the PC/MAC version is now grossly inconsistent with the feature tiers of the competition. - Intuit appears to be relying on the stickiness of the TurboTax brand with its customers in order to bridge across this transition. The fact that Intuit/TurboTax can cite a 2-4% customer impact clearly means that a study was conducted to understand the financial impact of adjusting the feature tiers and the amount of any financial impact has been ""bounded."" I would strongly suspect that even the offering of a free upgrade to the Premier edition is part of the ""stickiness"" plan. - Personally, I can't justify paying $70 for Premier (price as of this writing) versus $35 from a well-established competitor (HRB) for virtually the same feature tier. The TurboTax brand just isn't that sticky for me. I would probably switch even if the competitor's product didn't import the TurboTax data files, but it does so it's an even easier decision. It's ultimately all about the money. All the rest is just pretty words and branding. I'm paying x for a feature set from the competitor and 2x for the basically the same feature set from Intuit. TurboTax has always had a little bit of a price premium through recent years, but 2x is too much. Thanks again to all of the reviewers for getting the word out.

I now find out that the Deluxe is not what it was in years past. I agree with all of the negative adjectives thrown at Intuit. Face it Intuit. You made a bad business decision. You may ultimately end up with more cash in your coffers but you have alienated a whole lot of previously happy, loyal customers. Despite the fact that I have used TurboTax for the last 10+ years, I will be moving to another product. You must have been listening to Mr. Gruber but the American consumer is not as stupid as you think ."
78,R39IHD6MPIUD9A,"Intuit Execs: You may want to check those golden parachutes for holes","Thanks to previous reviewers for bringing this to the forefront for those of us who would have not thought twice about continuing our customer loyalty with Turbo Tax Deluxe. I hope some heads roll for this decision at the top to Intuit as double digit market share is sure to be lost for this one. So instead of adding functionality to the platforms where it is missing, the most logical choice is to remove it from the oldest platform? And this decision had nothing to do with making more money? How ignorant do you think we are? Why was this functionality missing from the online and mobile deluxe versions in the first place? H&R Block, here is your chance to shine. You are finally getting your chance with my family and I will encourage my friends to do the same. Maybe this will encourage more people to talk with their congressman/woman to push for a free option from the IRS since we all pay our taxes for such services anyhow (at least those who are using this type of software). Consumers: Today you have the power to vote with your wallet, try anybody but Turbo Tax this year. This will both show Intuit how easy it is to lose customer loyalty, and give a warning signal to other tax software providers who may consider the same misstep."
79,R30LQFLRSSTQO,"For last 15 years I was using TurboTax Deluxe for ...","For last 15 years I was using TurboTax Deluxe for Federal and State. Again this year, without giving a second thought I bought TurboTax Deluxe with one State for doing my 2014 taxes. Afterwards, it came as a surprise that this year TurboTax made a change in deluxe version without informing their loyal customers in that it has no schedules C, D or E. I lost money, but I am planning not to use TurboTax for 2014 taxes. I am going to Amazon.com to buy HR Block software and use it for 2014 taxes as well in future. For me TurboTax is no longer good."
80,R4KYEO6BQ8HK,"Looks like HR Block is going to have a GREAT year","Just wanted to let Intuit know they've lost yet another longtime user. Looks like HR Block is going to have a GREAT year! Gotta love when greed gets packaged as ""improvement"". Hey Intuit... you better hire more csr's because you're going to have a whole lot of dissatisfied customers this year! edit - I've noticed a Intuit VP trying to defend their changes on Amazon, stating it was so necessary and better for everyone and not at all motivated by greed. Say what you like but public perception is everything, you should know that. If you are going to remove features that have been there all along, you should change the name of the product. By keeping it ""Deluxe"" you are misrepresenting it. Say McDonalds decides to change how they make a Big Mac and make it with only one patty, but then offers an Ultra Big Mac (for twice as much money) with two patties. Do you think people are going to think that the Big Mac has changed? Of course not, they will assume the Ultra has 3 patties or something. Whether it was intentional or not, you made a huge mistake by continuing to use the same name of Deluxe and I would advise you stop with your nonsense justifications and explanations and admit you screwed up."
81,R1YS4CKTF39P8N,"Time to Move On!","Came here to get my TurboTax Deluxe and when I see over 1300 negative reviews made me pause. Like most of the reviews have been using TurboTax for years. But it seems each year they raise the price and include less features and the newer features I did not care for. Like most reviewers looks like the time to move on. Its time to vote with your pocket book so I purchased the H&R Block deluxe software for about $35 that will do everything TurboTax 2013 but now they want close to $75 for the same comparable software."
82,R21I8FQFVCM6FI,"The End of a 23 Year Relationship","1991 was the first year I used TurboTax, which was the first program that really illustrated to me the benefits of Windows over DOS! It thought it was so cool that you could click on a number and ""drill down"" to the underlying schedule. I was hooked. Every since then I have used TT to do my tax return plus those of friends and relatives that covered a wide variety of tax situations. That's twenty-three years altogether. There won't be a twenty-fourth. Intuit has exploited my loyalty and their market position one step two far with their latest product and pricing shenanigans. I'm switching to H&R Block's Tax software. Good riddins Intuit and TurboTax. It was a nice relationship while it lasted, but you've worn out your welcome. I strongly encourage all former users of TurboTax to vote with their dollars and switch to H&R Block's software. I want heads to roll at Intuit. ********** Addendum 1/31/15: I just learned that Intuit has recognized its mistake, is implementing free upgrades for 2014, and has promised to return the features for the 2015 version of TT Deluxe. This doesn't change the fact that it was an incredibly stupid move on Intuit's part. However, I always maintain that ANY organization (or individual) can make a mistake, but the true test of customer service is how they respond to the mistake. Customer loyalty has been to known to INCREASE when a company makes good after a stumble. That said, Intuit's initial response to the mistake was weak and insulting, with a bogus justification for the change instead of admitting the error of the change, but they seem to have finally seen the light and decided they need to do the right thing. So, on the one hand, I want to accept their apology and move on, and continue to use TurboTax. On the other hand, I worry about the huge market position they hold and the potential likelihood of them pulling something like this again in the future. I have to wonder if they would have even thrown us this bone had it not been for the existence of another credible tax software provider: H&R Block. It might be a good idea if enough of us decided to switch to H&R Block, anyway, just to ensure TurboTax always has competition to keep them honest. I look at what's happened to Quicken, which no longer has any decent competition: They foist whatever changes they want on users and we have no recourse other than to stop using personal computer-based financial software if we don't want to pay for their incessant ""upgrades"" which add nothing but the time it takes to complete anything. What to do, what to do..."
83,R2PEIDMK4JAEUF,"H&R Block is cheaper, better, and has more forms by far!","ZERO stars. Luckily I didn't buy it, switched to H&R Block and saved $40. I hope those involved in this decision to cripple the program so everyone would have to buy Premier are fired. I have read every arrogant comment by this so called VP at TT, that alone was enough to get me to switch. What a joke, I hope their sales tank. By the looks of the reviews he accomplished that. One final note, switch this year. I wouldn't put it past them to make their data files non-transferable to another companies in the near future. You have been warned!"
84,R164MSCSRC7Q6M,"Avoid TurboTax, read the reviews BEFORE you buy","The other reviews make an abundant case for avoiding TurboTax. I wish I had read them before making my purchase. I've now spent more time dealing with Intuit than I have doing my taxes, and I'm shocked at their behavior. They come across less like a large corporation and more like some fly-by-night scam artist. 1. The original announcement about changes to the product line-up described it all as an enhanced customer experience without giving sufficient detail to evaluate it. I can't find the original to verify as it has been replaced by the ""We messed up..."" message. 2. The software waits until you have entered as much information as possible before it tells you that an upgrade is necessary to complete your return. In my case, the need for a specific form was triggered by carry-forward info from last years return. The need for an upgrade was known right at the beginning when the prior year return was imported. Did it tell me then - No! Better to have me invest hours in my return before demanding more money to continue. 3. When I called Intuit support to understand why my simple return required an upgrade, they eventually gave me a free upgrade to the Premier version of the product, telling me that the state return is included as in the Deluxe version I originally purchased. It took over an hour on the phone to get the new product downloaded and installed. 4. When I got to the state return, the product would claim that the state download was already installed, then when I tried to start working on it would force another attempt to download it. After another hour on the phone with Intuit support, and after multiple re-installs and reboots, the support person put me on hold and came back to tell me that I need to buy the state download. After I pointed out that I had been told that it's included, and another ten minutes on hold, he tells me that he's sorry but the prior support person had mis-informed me. 5. At that point I had had enough of Intuit and decided to return the product and asked for instructions to do so. He insisted that Intuit only handles returns when the product is purchased directly from them, and that I would have to handle the return with Amazon directly. 6. After trying to handle it via Amazon, only to learn ""This item isn't eligible for return"", I called Intuit support again and got someone who knew how to initiate the return. After providing the requested information, I was told I'd get an email in 2-3 weeks confirming that the return request was being processed. That means that they won't even acknowledge that I've requested a refund until the end of the 60-day window for requesting a refund! I asked for an email that at least showed that I had requested a refund that day, and was told that would be no problem. I'm still waiting..."

I achieved that by providing needed service and ever increasing functionality - NOT deleting functionality. I've used Turbotax since it only printed forms in the 1980's. I'm sorry, but you blew it with this ill considered change. And no, I'm NOT going to call you. Bye Bye Bob."
86,R2B767WEG9SAO4,"the terrible explanations from Intuit aside","In the middle of preparing my taxes with the Deluxe version, which I have used for many years to my satisfaction, TurboTax told me I needed to upgrade to the Home and Business version to handle about $150 worth of expenses. The upgrade cost would be $30 according to the Deluxe version. When I followed the links to the online store, I was told the cost was $40. I declined to buy the upgrade not wanting to support Intuit in their false advertising. This morning I called customer support and worked with a new guy who had to keep putting me on hold to talk with his supervisor. Almost 40 minutes into the call he said he was arranging for a $10 discount - simply matching what Intuit was legally required to do. I said that after 40 minutes on the phone, the upgrade should be free. He placed me on hold again to talk with his supervisor. I was disconnected 2 minutes later. I was searching for alternative tax prep solutions when I came across an article in the NYTimes that said ""TurboTax is working with unhappy customers âcase by case,â said Ms. Gatlin. Mr. Dworsky of Consumer World said he called Intuit to complain and was offered a free upgrade. He advised others who were unhappy to do the same thing."" So, I called customer support again (another 15 minutes on hold) and asked the next, new customer support rep why I had not been offered a free upgrade when I called the first time. She had to check with her supervisor and came back saying that because the first support rep had set me up for a $10 discount, she could do nothing. I asked to speak with her supervisor. After a final 5 minute hold she came back and offered me an additional $5 discount. I hung up. So, Intuit is running a course on how to lose customers with false advertising and making customers jump though hoops just to get the advertised price. Be aware of what you are NOT buying with the deluxe version, the terrible explanations from Intuit aside. Amazon - why NOT provide a zero star option?"
87,R3G4Y7WXM6LKV0,"Lasted longer than my marriage, but ended the same way.","My relationship with TurboTax lasted longer than my marriage, but ended with about the same feelings of being cheated and gouged, so sad. I used TurboTax for the first time in 1995 just to see how it would do, compared to an H&R Block office. H&R Block didn't charge a prep fee if your calculations matched theirs. TurboTax had my refund $1 higher than H&R Block so I had to pay a $69 preparation fee + a filing fee. I swore to the H&R Block rep then & there that H&R Block had lost my business forever. I've been a loyal TurboTax user ever since. This year's debacle has ended my 20 year relationship with TurboTax. Firstly, I don't like the sneak attack, changing features to gouge users. In my research, I found that other tax software (namely Tax Cut) was SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper and rated higher by respectable review sites (PC Mag). $35 for TurboTax Deluxe + 15 For TurboTax State OR $12.99 for TaxAct Deluxe + $7 for TaxAct State. So $50 vs $20. It seems that after 20 years, I'm right back at square one with a tax preparer trying to screw me over."

Since the year-to-year costs of updating TurboTax have clearly been minimal for the last several years, the cost of TurboTax should decrease, not go up. I thus find Intuit's attempt to both raise the price and force us to use a more expensive version to be one of the worst of business practices. I can just imagine the discussion around a conference table as the decision to take these actions was considered. Did anyone consider how it would make us, the users, feel? Did they decide they would get enough new money to make up for the lost customers? Did anyone advise against the decision? Well, I am retired and no longer have a conference table to sit around and make decisions. But I have decided not to ever support a company with such little regard for its long term customers. I find the $25 rebate for sticking with TurboTax insulting. Anyone who is taken in by this has my sympathy. I have switched to TaxACT. I find it easy to use. It costs less. It includes all forms. Anyone considering TurboTax should take a serious look at TaxAct. HR Block's TaxCut is another possibility. TurboTax -- Boo! Boo! Boo!"

C-EZ, if you are eligible to use it. Intuit, YOU BLEW IT! Not only did you raise the price, but you degraded the product! In order to do my taxes with TurboTax, (like I have for the last 25 years, BTW) I must now pay triple the price I have paid in previous years to get the same functionality. I'm done with TurboTax. Time to try a new tax software."
91,RQY4827CWW4EY,"It looks like it is easier to use","Almost 2 decades ago I switched from doing my taxes on paper to using TurboTax. I used them every year since then. A couple of years ago, the product started going downhill while the cost was going uphill. After reading the reviews for this year, I made the switch to H&R Block's software. H&R includes the ability to transfer last year's TurboTax information into their software. It looks like it is easier to use, it has more functionality, covers more forms, has free support and is cheaper. Switching away from TurboTax is a no brainer for me."

I did not claim or do anything different than I have been for years, but now they have arbitrarily decided to charge us more to do the same thing. Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, but after over 10 years of using TurboTax I was accustomed to the product and never would have envisioned the changes this year.

TurboTax has eliminated Schedules D, among other things, from their 2014 Deluxe version (reporting Capital Gains and losses) and I will not pay the substantially higher price to move up to the Premier edition. Providing less for more each year seems to be a trend at Turbo Tax. The H&R Block Deluxe version will do everything TurboTax Deluxe used to do at a much lower price, making it, in my opinion, a much better choice."

Netflix got themselves into the same predicament a year or so ago and then quickly re-thought their corporate marketing strategy after customers left in droves. Just wait till your customers who haven't read these reviews get into the middle of their taxes and find out they have to upgrade. Where Netflix had little competition and many of their customers returned, yours' will not. I would love to be a fly on your boardroom wall right now. Update: Well I took the plunge and purchased H&R Block today. It installs easily, is cheaper than TurboTax and seamlessly imports you TT files.

My ""small business"" has net profits of $4000 annually so they want to extort 1% of my profit after I've purchased the software, after the return is prepared, for the privilege of eFiling.

Just as I was about to click the buy button I noticed the low star rating and decided to read some of the reviews--glad I did. I need the schedule D and with broker data import. I think what really frosts people is not the fact that the price went up--it's the sneaky way that unsuspecting buyers were duped into buying what they thought was their normal product and then they were forced to cough up another 30 bucks or lose their entire investment. This is no way to do business and it will lose a lot of customers--including me. Had they merely increased the cost by ten bucks nobody would have cared--most everything goes up a little.. I just downloaded the less expensive H & R Block program and did a preliminary mockup of my 2014 return in minutes---very smooth, didn't have to read any directions. It didn't install any other unwanted programs. It imported by 2013 Turbotax information perfectly--I didn't even have to tell it where to fiind it.

This is the first time, I've had to struggle to find places in the form for my entries. It seems that the people at Turbo Tax have streamlined the program to its bare bones.

The REAL requirements ""Valid for customers who filed their 2013 taxes with TurboTax Deluxe (CD or download), completed prior year data transfer this year, and encounter an upgrade to either 2014 TurboTax Premier or 2014 TurboTax Home & Business (CD or download)"" So it's not 'returning' customers it's for 2013 CD/download customers ONLY. In my case, I had not filed with 2013 turbotax due to complications I was not comfortable with and went to a CPA instead. 15 years+ with Turbotax is not a 'returning customer' in their eyes, and even though they claim they will change the software for NEXT year.. they still opt to leave this trap in for 2014. Completely unacceptable. Thank god Amazon stood behind their customer for me and allowed me to cancel this order."
116,R3RKD1SLL7RV1X,"Thankfully there are other options available...a.k.a. the competition.","Wow...I'm glad I spent the time to read through many of these reviews. I've been a user since 1997, growing increasingly annoyed with each year's release, and am now unwilling to continue using their product. From the backhanded methods of trying to push you to more expensive versions, to the continual focus on the rebate $$$ they are ""helping"" you to find, culminating with this years' Schedule changes, leave me unable to trust them with my business or personal details. Even their website appears to have fake reviews pumping non-descript high ratings. Thankfully there are other options available...a.k.a. the competition. ********* Update to review - I purchased H&R Block Deluxe on 12/23 and can immediately say I'm sold. Much more straightforward interface, no annoying plugs for upgrading, no ""rebate mania"", better price/value. It imported all my prior TT data. TTQuicken (Intuit) had better heed the backlash to their methods. Switching to the competition was quite easy...and I held out for years, expecting them to take feedback seriously."
117,R3EDFOV79M33IR,"The power of the consumer!","I have been disgruntled in the past by Intuit's business practices. Having inadvertently signed up for ""automatic renewal"" in 2012, I was surprised when my account was debited in AUGUST for the new software - no email, no phone call, no warning. When I tried to cancel the subscription to the automatic renewal, there was a limited time window to do so. All in all, I felt like I had been ""taken"" and used it again (after I got off automatic renewal and provided NO information with my purchase) only because I had the history of all the years I used Turbo Tax. After reading about the C-D schedule mess and the manufacturer's responses to reviews on this site, I went out on a limb and purchased H&R Block software. I started working with it yesterday. The Turbo Tax returns were imported without any issue and I found the software to be straight forward and user friendly and MUCH cheaper. So goodbye Turbo Tax and shady business practices! You really can't fool all of the people all of the time..."
118,RAX0CWPVLF7E2,"Insult to injury","I won't repeat the original issue with TurboTax. Plenty here have explained it well. The latest is that Intuit is storing SSN numbers of all of their previous customers, even desktop users. This is completely unacceptable, and dangerous. I used the desktop version to keep my personal information off the internet. Now I find out they have captured my sensitive information and it is stored online, on their servers, susceptible to hackers worldwide. I think a class action lawsuit is in order. We see Intuit employees here in the reviews attempting damage control on their underhanded pricing... How will they handle the latest (and most egregious) misstep? For me, they should delete my personal info. Beyond that, I will never spend another dime with Intuit."
119,R1I7EJU5EQMADU,"What's Deluxe??","What's Deluxe about a product that a doesn't support a simple capital gain, How about Basic, oh That's been used.. I have been a TurboTax user since the early 1990's but the recent changes are ridiculous. Anyone that has any mutual funds is going to need schedule D at some point. The deluxe product is a JOKE, a simple case of a greedy company trying to increase revenues by extorting money from their unaware customer base!!"
120,R34SCBUMKNS504,"Dumb move by Intuit","I will be looking at TaxCut this year. Intuit has totally ruined a 10+ love affair that I had with TurboTax due to removing some critical forms from the Deluxe (and even the Premier) version. I use Schedule F and now I have to buy the Business version to do my taxes using TurboTax. Due to the changes Intuit chose to make, I will be willing to pay just as much for TaxCut just on principle."
121,R3BRP5CMBP2HW4,"Goodbye TurboTax! Won't be back!","I purchased TurboTax deluxe software at a retailer just like I have for the past 12 years. I did not break the seal or open the case so I will be returning it to the retailer. I do not need the missing forms for my tax situation but I am standing in solidarity with those who do need these forms. I paid the same price for a watered down version of the software I have used for many years. On top of that, my state (MN) has stopped accepting e-files prepared with TurboTax. Enough is enough. I am so completely sick of corporate arrogance and greed, that Intuit will never again get even a single nickle of my money, no matter how much they grovel and issue sappy apologies. How I long for the days of businesses truly valuing their customers and treating them right no matter the bottom line. I have used H&R Block software many years ago and was plenty satisfied with it. They will now have a returning and longterm customer for as long as they treat me right. Goodbye TurboTax!"
122,R1KNKPE20NXAOI,"May the seeds of greed bear bitter fruit.","Like numerous other _former_ Turbo Tax users, I find Intuit's greed here to be disturbing. The company's responses are a mix of disingenuousness (the old product lineup was confusing), belittling (only 2-4% of users are affected), greasing the squeaky wheel (we'll give you an upgrade if you call and complain loudly enough), non-answers (you can still use schedules C, D, and E -- but then it won't error check your return, and you'll have to paper file), and general irrelevance (you can call one of our customer service reps who will be happy to recommend what version you should get). Had the immediate response been ""yes, we see that we messed up really badly; we will give everyone who bought a copy of Deluxe an upgrade, no questions asked, we'll sell the top of the line product for the Deluxe price, and we've learned our lesson and will do right by our customers in the future"", this might have blown over. Now? No way. I have posted a link to this review page to Facebook, where I have quite a few friends and followers whom I don't want to see be shabbily treated. That will probably cost Intuit more sales, not just people who will now realize that the old mainstay Deluxe is not the right product, but also people who might not have been directly affected but whose sense of honor and propriety is outraged by such sharp practice. I can't say for certain, but if the company is correct that only 2-4% of its customers are affected, I expect that the loss of sales will greatly outweigh the incremental revenue from higher prices. I certainly hope that that is the case. And by the way, Mr. Meighan, if you were concerned about inconsistencies in your product line, you could have chosen to upgrade the functionality of your online and mobile products to match those of the desktop rather than the other way around. And if the bottom line really was the bottom line (as you have implied with your comment about ""duty to shareholders""), you could have raised the prices by 5-10% across the board with at most mild grumbling. Yes, I am aware that you would probably offer me a free upgrade if I took the trouble to call, since I could prove that I'm a returning customer. But that would require extra effort on my part and would simply reward your business practice, which I am not willing to do."
123,R2IC0TDQNEATKL,"Tried to sneak a price increase in version changes and got caught - is very sorry and wants to make up. Too late for me.","Stuck with Turbotax through the DRM debacle (didn't have options) but when I found that I would have to pay through the nose to handle stock sales (after having to do research), I decided to try H&R block. It was much cheaper and after installing it and going through the process, I found it to be a non-issue to make the switch. I only use turbotax once a year so its always a learning curve to use the software and found that getting used to the H&R block's interface was not any more difficult than the yearly change in Turbotax. Matter of fact I found it intuitive and easy to navigate. Imports worked exactly like they did in Turbotax. While you can now work through the process with Turbotax to get a free upgrade to the version that should never have cost more in the first place, I do not understand why anyone would do it."
124,R3IHEKTNENJJFE,"Good Job, Turbo-Tax, you've lost a twenty year customer","I'm certainly glad I read the online reviews, and thanks to LinkedIn for posting the CEO's ""Letter of Apology"", one of the most thinly disguised, cynical attempts to justify corporate greed I've ever witnessed. I've been a Turbo Tax User for nearly twenty years, and have been one of their most ardent, vocal fans. Having a great deal of experience in software development, I've often used Turbo Tax (as often as a few days ago) as a prime example of a well-constructed software application that uses an intuitive user interface and workflow to provide an excellent customer experience. While I've experienced a few glitches over the years, I appreciated that they were fixed quickly, and overall, my semi-complex filing requirements were met with a relatively small amount of effort. Well, you lost me with this maneuver, Intuit. Your claim that you were simply trying ""to align our desktop, online and mobile versions to deliver faster innovation and improved experiences for all customers"" by removing Schedules C, D, E, and F doesn't pass my ""sniff test"". Offering a single, one-time $25 rebate after I file electronically this year if I've already purchased the software, and filed in 2013 using Turbo Tax Deluxe?!!? I don't mean to sound catty, but that's just PATHETIC. I hope the decision maker in this is fired, regardless of position and stature, and I hope this decision is considered a ""black swan"" when you look back."
125,R2WOKTWEZ27LVG,"Don't buy this product. You will regret it!","This product is not the complete 'Deluxe' version that use to support all the schedules that a joint filer would require. Using this product requires additional fees in order to complete the return. In addition, recent developments at the Intuit website raises questions about the security of the system and possible vulnerabilities for identity theft. Lastly, the the softwar eperformacne of this program is very poor. Expct long launch times, lengthy software updates times and very slow response. I am sofware developer and have a high-end PC and still the prgram response is painfully slow. After 20 year of using Turbo Tax I'm done!

I've been Turbo Tax/Intuit user since late 90s but this latest ""for the sake of consistency"" underhanded move by TT removing schedules and forms and subsequently forcing users to upgrade for more money - that's just too much!!! This will be my last year purchasing TT but only so I can compare the refund amount to H&R and TaxAct. I guess comparison all 3 would cost me a bit more and take a bit, quite a bit, more time - but I'm willing to invest my money and time to find a suitable alternative. That's it Turbo Tax - you've done it, no more business from me! Fool me once - shame on you, but fool me twice.... I remember previous DRM debacle when Intuit backpedaled similar to this year. I also despise their Quicken piece of s**** crap but lack of alternative FORCES me to stay with them. How I wish Microsoft would resurrect their MS Money or someone else would come up with semi decent money management software. No more Turbo Tax, no more.

Even though I had 100's of stock transactions I have always been able to use TurboTax Basic to do my taxes, not needing all of the bells and whistles of the other versions. Now it would cost $90 because I would have to buy the Premiere edition. They have destroyed the trust of their loyal customers with a single stupid marketing strategy that must have been approved by a committee of clowns! Kudos to all of the negative TurboTax reviewers to alert the public of this Intuit scam. Keeping others from learning that they now have purchased the wrong product in the middle of trying to finish their taxes. The dark side of me hopes that Intuit learns its lesson by losing its carefully built market share to H&R Block. Apparently they must relearn the importance of customer loyalty and not scamming the very people that have supported them for decades. A rousing applause for H&R Block for not taking advantage of TurboTax's misguided and deceptive marketing by increasing their pricing. But, in fact offering a 50% discount (Jan 2nd only) on the Deluxe version which still supports schedule D and direct access to the forms! All for $22!"

Google ""H&R Block Giving Free Tax Software to Disgruntled TurboTax Users"" to see if their offer is still open and the correct email address to use. ** This year TurboTax Deluxe has removed support for Schedules C and D. (You can still fill in the forms in the software and file your return on paper if you want.) I might give it 2-stars, except I just got their ""We're sorry and we want to make it right"" letter chocked full of weasel-talk. Instead of being honest about why they removed support for Schedules C and D, they say: ""However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line."" In essence, ""we did this to avoid confusion and help us be more innovative."" Right."
129,RDEJ04CYR4X24,"TurboTax has erroneously classified customers by the schedules they need","Thank you for the heads up. We have used Turbo Tax for years, but will no longer. They know they have angry customers and are offering a $25 discount this year only. Not much help. We must file Schedule C to deduct continuing education expenses. We had a no change audit by the IRS and were told to move continuing education expenses to Schedule C. That moves us to a higher software category. We have no home business. We also have a tree farm which does not require farming, but must be filed on Schedule F. There are no crops to sell, no employees, and no need to do anything yet. We will harvest trees in 50 years. Because we need the extra schedules even though there is no income associated with them, TurboTax has decided that we are farmers and that we have a business. They think we need all the other options that would be needed if we indeed did have a business or farmed. We have only expenses, not income and they must be filed on these additional schedules. Removing these schedules is a problem. We have no need to do the extra things these higher level products provide. All we want to do is manually enter our expenses. Restricting the tax forms is what is angering customers. TurboTax should know that just because a customer needs a particular schedule, it doesn't mean they can be classified as having a business or being a farmer or whatever else. I sympathize with the anger and there is no way to justify what TurboTax has done. Fortunately, there are alternatives. Thank you all for the suggestions"
130,R1PXWOZC7RKZFI,"Once again the folks who brought you Turbo Tax decided to quietly annoy their loyal customers by making a questionable decision","Let me start out by saying that Intuit destroyed this years version of Turbo Tax. If you don't want to have Intuit electronically file your State return, Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 Federal and State contains errors that prevents it from generating a usable copy of my Ohio state tax return that can be filed by mail. Once again the folks who brought you Turbo Tax decided to quietly annoy their loyal customers by making a questionable decision to alter their product in a detrimental way. Many years ago it was adding copy protection that only ended up interfering with their customers ability to install the product. This time it was to quietly remove functionality from the program without telling anyone. This was followed by an unapologetic apology, that was followed by an apology for the apology, stating they would return Turbo Tax back to its original state. Unfortunately, in this change in design, and quick hustle to change back , they broke what used to be a robust and reliable program. Here are some images that show my experience with Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014. 1. After downloading the Turbo Tax Installer and running it, Turbo Tax said I had to uninstall a previous version. The first picture shows the crash that followed this operation. 2. Next I re-ran the downloader. This time Turbo Tax continued with the install, but said I was installing the Basic version. 3. After completing my tax return, I tried to print copies of my returns for my records. This is what the State form looked like. It was watermarked with huge words saying the tax form was not final. How could it be not final when I had already completed my return and submitted the forms electronically. 4. Lastly, Turbo Tax never actually generated an Ohio State form that looks like the Ohio tax document so I could mail in my tax return. What it did do was regenerate the Federal 1040 form along with my other state documents, even though I only had the State form selection checked when I told it to create a preview copy of my Ohio tax return. With all these managerial and software design mistakes, Turbo Tax has plummeted from being the flagship Tax Preparation software, to something I'd be ashamed to offer people as a free-ware program."
131,RMADX82BV8QBL,"From ""Buy"" to ""Bye-Bye"" TurboTax in one simple lesson","I've been a satisfied, loyal customer of TurboTax for the past 2 decades. But I don't feel that this year's sneak attack on TT Deluxe users was a simple mistake. It feels like an intentional, cynical, manipulative corporate attempt to raise revenues without admitting to raising prices. The vacillating, flip-flopping attempts at justification and apology feel like the insincere (and in some cases financially insufficient) products of some crisis-management consultant. Fortunately, I was able to take advantage of HR Block's kind (and savvy) offer of a free replacement program, which I hope will become my regular program, presuming it performs equivalently this year (and so far it looks good -- easy and quick installation with no problem importing my 2013 TurboTax info). I thought all retailers knew that it is far cheaper to retain an existing customer than to attract a new replacement customer -- I guess the TurboTax folks were absent from class the day they taught that in Business School."
132,R2IT8FL0IXKTB8,"Good luck upgrading","Despite the negative reviews I purchased TurboTax Deluxe because I am a loyal customer and it appeared to me that Turbo Tax had taken the necessary steps to correct the changes in the product and provide refunds to those that already made purchases. According to Amazon and to Turbotax a free upgrade to Premier is available for customers that used Deluxe last year and it is available online after February 7th. I purchased Deluxe, got to the section that asked for my K-1 information, Turbo Tax indicated that I qualified for a free upgrade to Premier, and that's where the fun began. After repeated unsuccessful attempts to upgrade online and receiving the message, ""We're having trouble processing your request online,"" I decided to call the 800# provided. After 26 minutes of waiting hold, I gave up. So now I'm stuck in limbo... I can't file my return because the software won't allow me to enter the information from K-1 and I can't upgrade to Premier because it doesn't work online and no one will pickup the phone when I call. Then I tried to contact customer service online and it was suggested that I call customer service and the wait time is ""less than 3 hours."" Are you kidding me!"

I don't mind spending a few more bucks each year for the consistency but not $70 dollars. Sorry TT but you have lost a long time valued customer. If you were't so greedy I would be staying with you for many years to come but not now. HR Block is offering a free download of their software when you show evidence of purchasing TT. When you think you have locked in your customer and you don't look over your shoulder for the competition than you are just arogant (and naive)."

I have been a loyal TT user since the 90s and now feel slapped in the face. It's ridiculous to force loyal customers to pay an extra $20 to upgrade to the Premier version to make up lost functionality from the Deluxe version. As such, I have decided to switch to HR Block Deluxe to complete my 2014 personal return. And it's $10 cheaper - bonus! I hate to leave you TT after being faithful to you for all these years, but you lost my trust. Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, it appears you lost a lot of other customers this year too. This was a bad business decision. Lessons learned!"

I will say, however, that the first ""we're sorry"" e mail from TT was one of the stupidest explanations and half-a@@ apology I have ever read! It was poorly written and didn't even read like it was written by a college graduate. Now we get yet another ""we get it"" e mail. Nothing short of offering the Business Version for the price of the Deluxe will work for me. I do not want to start the flawed Deluxe just to get prodded with some hastily inserted ""free upgrade."" Give me the Upgrade Version in the first place or I'm going to H&R Block. Over the past 15 years I have had growing concerns over the rising costs of the ""free"" State Version and now am hearing about security concerns. Time to move on.

However, in the tradition of such wonderful corporate decisionmaking as that which resulted in the ""NEW COKE"" and Netflix's gambit splitting online access from DVD rental plans and hiking the prices, Intuit has jumped the shark this year. The heavy hand with which Intuit browbeat customers with promotional offers during tax filing has come out of the glove; this year the company eliminated various core features in the midlevel tiers of their products, effectively jacking the prices up significantly.

Intuit (the company that makes Turbo Tax) must think their customers are idiots. TT Deluxe has been great for years but this year I would have had to move up to ""Premier"" ($70) to get Sch D & Sch E (which are 2 very common forms). Then after a little more researching I found out that I would have to move up to ""Home & Business"" ($80) to get Sch. C. Instead, I'm making the switch to H&R Block Deluxe and getting all that for only $34 (a savings of about $46 as compared to TT). Turbo Tax must be praying that their returning customers don't do their homework and then when they realize that they need a form they'll be a pop up saying that for an extra $$ they'll move your version up. By that point they're betting that you won't want to start over and will pay up. Thanks to all the reviews on Amazon I looked into it and realized I don't need to be price gouged by Intuit. I've read/heard good things about H&R Block's tax software for years so this year might as well be the one to give it a try. I hope Intuit gets the message that their customers have other options."

Last year their software was buggy with mathematical discrepancies that even their CEO flat out denied (lied) in his desperate act of corporate Damage Control. This was finally the straw that broke the camel's back. Going over to H&R Block and I suggest others do the same and no longer support this greedy monopolistic corporation."

This option is now gone and I have to use the Deluxe version for $35. As is the case for many others, I've used TurboTax for 20 years (since 1995) and would not normally bother looking at alternatives. However, given Intuit's money grab this year, I went ahead and re-did my taxes on the H&R Block site (online product). It was actually easier than TurboTax, in that they determined in advance that I didn't qualify for things like a tuition credit based on my income. TurboTax made me fill out all of the information before telling me I didn't qualify. More importantly, H&R Block is $20. Sorry Intuit.

Instead I found out today that the state forms will not have the DO NOT FILE watermark removed from them until February 20th!

There was one status showing the product was shipped on 1/29, even though the delay notification email was send on 1/30; 3. Current status of the order shows Backorder; 4. Due to the Backorder status, the order can not be cancelled. I'll need to wait for the order to be processed, and return for refund. After ~10mins, the baffled representative determined: - Nothing was actually 'shipped' on 1/29 (CD or download); - It didn't make sense to have a download product to be in Backorder (he laughed, <insert your own electron joke here>); - I still need to wait for the credit card to be charged first, then refunded 2-4 weeks later.

No, I'm offended by the way that TurboTax crippled the product I've always used and hid this fact deep in the product details. Buy the product you've always purchased and Surprise! you'll need to spend more $$ to upgrade to the product you really need. After the initial spend, many customers will decide it's easier to pay more than to start over with another product, and I suspect that Intuit was counting on this technique which amounts to ""dirty pool"". The company's ""defense"" for this marketing decision is riddled with weasel words and so is the CEO's so-called apology. Didn't your mother teach you that when you apologize you need to *mean it*, too? Now they're insulting those who purchased the Deluxe product and paid to upgrade, by offering a $25 refund after filling out a bunch of paperwork. Really? You couldn't just give a free upgrade via download to your loyal customers? We've been loyal to you, why not be loyal to us? Enough already. I won't be considering TurboTax again.

UPDATE - FREE UPGRADE","*** UPDATE 1-28-2015 *** For those who would like to allow Intuit to make it right for this year, I found success with the following: 1 - Call their customer service number at 800-445-1875 (8 AM to 8 PM EST) 2 - Do NOT opt to be called back. Stay on the line. When I chose to be called back, the call was returned by an affiliated CPA who could do nothing for me other than the $25 rebate. 3 - Reference the Forbes article by Janet Novack wherein TurboTax VP Bob Meighan ""assured Forbes that every agent at that number has 'discretion to do what's necessary' to keep a customer - meaning, he said, they will give customers a free upgrade if they demand it"". 4 - You will need to have TurboTax Deluxe for 2014 installed as they need the serial number and will walk you though the upgrade while you have the program open, and your tax return started. 5 - I had already installed TT Deluxe for last year, before learning about the killing of features, but had it boxed and in the car to take back to the store where purchased. The above worked and I received a free upgrade to the version which I needed to continue my taxes. We will see what Intuit does going forward, but it provides an option for today, for those who feel inclined to give them a chance to make good. Good luck! -- Original Review -- Dear Mr. Goodarzi, Like millions of others, I received your email on 1/23/2015. Because I had not started my taxes, I was unaware of Intuit's deceptions until I read the email. I suspect there are many who have yet to learn of your serendipitous price gouge. I have had a few days to think about it, and I am angrier now than when I read the email. That is because the explanations are so hollow. 1 - No one is confused by portions of the software which they do not use. Your interview process guides them to only the parts which they need - correct? 2 - For nearly 25 years, without fail, I have purchased TurboTax Deluxe. Yes, the price has gone up, however I understand inflation. 3 - In that the capabilities of Deluxe have been reduced, shouldn't there have been a price REDUCTION? 4 - You can spin it any way you want, but the heart of the matter is you INTENTIONALLY REMOVED ESSENTIAL FORMS from Deluxe, FORCING ME TO PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COSTLY PRODUCT! 5 - If you were serious about the $25 rebate mentioned in the email, why not just allow me to order the product which I now need, and credit the $25? If I have to file an extension (the case for the past 3 years), I cannot claim this rebate. It is a rebate designed for breakage - hoping that many people will forget or not quality. 6 - Even if I do manage to meet the terms and receive the rebate, next year I will be paying close to $100 for the Turbo Tax software which I need, not the $60 from last year (both plus your add-ons). Unfortunately, your apology is nothing but politics. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME THAT I HAVE A POWERFUL VOICE IN THE WAY I SPEND MY MONEY. No more of it will be coming to Intuit. Even if the other options are more costly, I am casting my vote by returning my Turbo Tax software, and accepting H&R Block's free offer to the disenfranchised Turbo Tax users. That is how you will know that I am truly angered by your deceptions and hollow spin of an explanation."

I started using Quicken so that I could click on the Import function screen of TurboTax which I loved because it made it easy to do my taxes each day through out the year. Last year someone decided to take that ""Import"" feature out of TurboTax program Interview screens and hide it in the Windows ""File"" tab. It took me two days of emails and phone calls to find how to get Intuit's two main programs to share data. WHAT A DUMB MOVE. Now I find that someone decided to remove A, C, D and E forms from TurboTax Deluxe so that they make all of their loyal customers buy the next higher priced version of TurboTax. EVEN DUMBER MOVE.

First, TurboTax Deluxe no longer provides schedule Dâs required for capital gains from mutual funds. So this required updating to TurboTax Premier. But . . . . Second, after upgrading to TurboTax Premier, TurboTax Premir would not download the California State software. It kept thinking it was already downloaded. Third, so I called customer service. After waiting 15 minutes I was finally connected. The person helping me kept putting me on hold while she âresearchedâ the problem. She would suggest using another browser, etc. After too much time, I asked to be elevated to someone that could help. This could not be done she insisted. I asked for a supervisor. She claimed there was none. Finally the call disconnected. One and a half hours. Fourth, I found the solution after hunting around on the internet. Seems that TurboTax forgets where some files are located and becomes senseless. This is known to Intuit but why haven't they fixed it or notified users or their customer service?"

The one we chose affected the fewest number of customers."" -- no, either leaving it alone, as it was, or adding schedule C&D to the other variants would have affected less people (as in no one but Intuit itself). I have used TurboTax since (gasp) 1988, if I recall correctly. I still have my turbotax files online back to 1991 (23 years ago...) I even had to file Schedule K's and do income averaging back then - and it did it. How many people above the working poor and some twenty-somethings have *no* investments? If someone has investments, or sells *anything* for a gain/loss, they pretty much *have* to file Schedule D (or C) (and Deluxe won't work for that unless they made no trades, and got nothing but straight dividends). I'm sure the mass of people filing 1040-EZs don't need it, but they weren't the one who bought Deluxe in the past either. I've had to file Schedule D every year for 27 years with Turbotax (and once or twice C when I did a side contract for someone). I got blindsided by my wife purchasing it early before I had a chance to look at the Amazon page; we assumed Deluxe was Deluxe, not Deluxe-minus. Yes, I could call your customer service, and get upgraded, because I happened to see a news article and went here to read what was up. (I would have gotten *really* pissed if I'd done more than enter my basic family info and deep in preparing found ""you can't do that, would you like to upgrade?"") But why would I do that, when it's obvious that *next* year no such ""solution"" will be available, and it will be pay up $$$$ or pound sand? Might as well deal with the mental pain of switching products (after 26 years!) now and get it over with. I should have seen the writing on the wall when it became clear that my old Quicken would no longer function (at all) unless I bought an upgrade. I declined at the time, and simply let it expire in 2007. My wife forced me to give it a try again this year. It's amazing how unchanged it is -- which is not exactly a good thing 8 years later! And Mint, while pretty, can't handle all sorts of basic things Quicken can. The real travesty was that I'm sure they knew people would be blindsided, and could have changed the names (fully - no Basic/Deluxe/Premier, and make it much more prominent that people with *any* investments or *any* self-employed income need to re-evaluate which they get) - but they cynically decided they could weather the bad publicity. That was a dumb, dumb move. You had a lifelong devoted customer who told *everyone* to use Turbotax. No longer."

In the middle of doing my taxes for 2014, I found I would need to upgrade a level because I had sold some mutual fund shares and Intuit was no longer including the needed form in the Deluxe version. For an additional $32.69 I was upgraded and able to complete my taxes. After receiving many complaints, Intuit is going to offer the upgrade for free and is offering a $25 refund to those who had to pay. Last Friday I spent 40 minutes on hold trying to at least get the $25 refund -- finally hung up. Intuit, you just lost a long time customer....."
168,R3G3Y9D58SMYL8,"Warning--Deluxe is not what it has always been","Intuit has downgraded Deluxe without publicizing that in advance or on the packaging. They're offering a $25 credit for people to upgrade to Premier (which costs $30 more) or Home & Business (which costs $40 more)--though you only get the credit after you have fully filed your taxes with the more expensive version. For years, Deluxe has supported Schedules C and D (small businesses and investments), but this year one needs Premier for investments, Home & Business for any sole proprietorships. In contrast, H&R Block--whose Deluxe product is completely compatible with Intuit's former versions of Deluxe (i.e., handling Schedules C and D) and very comparable in how the software functions (I've used both TT and H&RB over the years)--understands the super faux pax Intuit has made and is offering a free copy of their Deluxe via their website to anyone who purchased TT Deluxe but needs the more expensive version now. Update 2.2.15 Intuit keeps getting worse and worse and worse. I won't repeat all the ridiculous choices the company has made out of greed, apparently, this year. Anyone can read the 2000+ negative reviews to find out about those. But I'd at least hope Intuit support was reasonable at this point after their fiasco. But no. Most recently, today I called to inquire about the free upgrade to Home & Business I am due per their VP. Some people have said they've received a long email from Intuit, and since I have not (though I am a decades-long TT customer), I called about it. Well, first off, it's no longer possible to even sit on hold a ridiculously long time. After a long series of prompts, the voice message says they'll call back, trying just once. After that one try, of course I have to re-go through the entire process. I've gone through it over 1/2 dozen times today and only once have talked to a live person. That rep assured me he'd walk me through downloading the proper H&B version (at no charge). Well, he failed. The serial number he claimed I should see on the screen he told me to go to was not there, period. I ended up having to leave for a while. He said no, he couldn't call me back later, I'd have to go through the entire process again. Meantime, he seems to have sent me a link supposedly to the H&B version. But it just takes me to a page that tells me I can download the software for free (of course that's ridiculous, as it means the user will be charged when they try to file--that's one of Intuit's many games). When I click the link for downloads, it shows me just Basic and Deluxe--not the H&B promised to me by the phone rep and by the follow up email. After Intuit's disasters this year, I have NO intention of filing my taxes with TT this year. I already have my free copy of H&R Block Deluxe and will file with that. But I want to compare the two to see if they do come out identical for my complex taxes or not. I also want to see if Intuit ever stops digging itself deeper and deeper into the ground this year. I'm not holding my breath about that. I sure wish Amazon had a ZERO stars option. Better yet, how about a negative 10 stars option? 4/1/2015 Update Well, TurboTax did restore the full functionality for this year and promises to return Deluxe to the product of old for next year. And as much as I hate to admit it, TT is a much smoother product than H&R Block for people with complex taxes, at least in my experience this year. I've used both H&R Block and TurboTax over the years. This year, I did my taxes using both products, to compare them. H&R Block failed miserably. TT has a much more robust, easy to use interview capability; H&RB's interview missed some significant Schedule C figures I need to enter still; and worst of all (along with some other less significant failures by H&RB Deluxe this year), H&RB refuses to download Fidelity data though I have absolutely confirmed the correct user name and password and that the Fidelity site is up and running just fine. Note Fidelity is an extremely large financial firm, so for H&RB to claim they download from the site then fail is a major failure. Also even if it did work, H&RB apparently requires one to download from the financial firms separately for 1099-Divs, 1099-Ints, 1099-Bs, 1099-Rs, etc. It puts the prompts for importing within the interviews of each of those forms' sections, not all together as TT did. So while I cannot forgive Intuit for its attempted money grab earlier this year (thus am leaving the one star as just one star), their product at least this year--now that it's returned to its old functionality--outshines H&RB at least in my experience, with complex taxes."

My first time using Turbo Tax was over 20 years ago, when my father bought me the software and in his elegant way of speaking said to me, ""Here you go knuckle head, use this."" I'll have to interpret what he meant to say which is. ""Hello my favorite son with the oddly shaped head. I have been using Turbo Tax to do my own taxes and I thought I would pass on my great knowledge to you so I have purchased you your first copy of Turbo Tax. Since that day I have been using turbo tax every year. I used it when I went to college, when I got married, when I had my first child. Turbo tax was there when I bought my first home and then every time I went up a tax bracket. I have used it for do my taxes through all my life changes and it has served me well. When tax time comes around and people complain about doing their taxes, just like my father I would say to them, "" Use Turbo Tax it's easier than you think to do your own taxes."" I have been your biggest cheerleaders and fans. I have told numerous family and friends how much I like turbo tax. Most of them now use Turbo Tax faithfully. To think of it, most use turbo tax except for a brother-in-law that uses H&R block. No one can convince him that Turbo Tax is better and he tries to make everyone switch to H&R block. Now unfortunately, I think he is right and I hate it when he is right. I can no longer recommend Turbo tax. I know you have to make a profit and I think everyone can appreciate that, but with your new tactics your simple going to lose your faithful customers base. Pease do the right thing and Instead of nickel and dimming your loyal customers, provide your customers with the product that they thought they were buying in the first place and refund those that had to pay extra. I don't think I need to clarify the issue. If you need further clarification please see the multitude of negative reviews on the internet, especially the ones on the biggest online sellers, Amazon. Once again , If you want to keep me and your other faithful customers, I urge you to do the right thing so at the very least I can tell my brother in law where to shove it."
172,R1DU27X9AMDQKY,"Beware the Decepticons !","Let me first say, I have been a user of Turbo Tax Deluxe for well over a decade. The work I do and investments I make require it. It was back in early December of 2014 that I began to hear rumblings of discontent with the TTD package. So, I decided to wait till tax season to see if Intuit (INTU) was going to make the world right in this matter. Well, it sort of did with a rebate for early purchasers of TTD though it is still a crippled product. But what this says to me is that this rebate is but a one time occurrence and thus, you will pay more next year for the features you will require. Their email to me apologizing for this ""misunderstanding"" is disingenuous at best. Last Friday, I purchased HR Block Deluxe. It has all the features that TTD once had for less cost. The installation and data migration* from TTD 2013 went flawlessly. Here it is Monday and my returns are ready for filing. Totally painless. Back in FY 2014, I suspected that there would be legions of taxpayers like me who would bail on TT so I did the prudent thing and sold off INTU from my portfolio (at a profit). Indeed, analysts are now forecasting forward revenue growth of -28% for INTU in 2015. The irony of this is, I will be reporting this capital gain on the sale of INTU using HR Block Deluxe tax software. LOL ! * I find it interesting that data migration from TT to competitive tax packages is quite easy. Then I thought, if I was a INTU executive and wanted to stymie this capability of my competitors, what would I do ? I would use proprietary encryption on saved data such that competitive tax packages could no longer migrate tax data from TT. Viola ! A captive audience. Now, they wouldn't do that, would they ? Think about that if you plan to continue using TT."

It is also just as easy to use as the Turbo Tax product, so don't worry about spending any extra time switching to H&R Block."

177,RNTB0LYMHSOA3,"Returns Rejected for Bogus Reason","I got an email from the TurboTax General Manager saying the same thing as the VP posted here, acknowledging what I had already discovered, that TurboTax is so bad this year that now I have to replace it with a different version and start over. I have done my taxes with TurboTax Deluxe for the past 7 years without a problem; this year with the new âDeductions and Homeowners Deluxeâ nothing but problems. I finally got through it and did both Federal and State (Maryland) e-File only to have them rejected because on the 16 Forms W2-G I hand poked in âthe Federal Identification Numbers (EIN) did not match the IRS database.â Well, thatâs just WRONG. All of the Federal Identification Numbers (EIN) are exactly CORRECT, and they are the exact same W2-G EINs that the IRS accepted for e-File without hesitation on my 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 returns, all done on TurboTax Deluxe. So I can only conclude that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with those EINs matching the IRS database, rather it is one more glitch in TurboTax that by its own admission is so hosed it has to be replaced. Is there any way to submit it again once it's been rejected?"

TurboTax is hands down the worst tax preparation software I've ever used, and I've been doing my own taxes (as well as for others occasionally) since 1995. Their ""help"" is also a joke, comprised of a user forum. That's it. You can't get assistance from Intuit or report bugs to them as far as I've been able to determine.

I even put up with their disastrous foray into only letting you use the software on one computer with annoying DRM without being too upset, but this year is beyond the pale. They've pulled out even basic support, which was limited but sufficient for my needs in their past versions and put it into only the highest levels of the software which cost way more and group simple things like a dividend being paid into software I'd need if I had a small business. I mean I make so little on a very meager investment the upgrade costs the better amount of my earnings. I've had it with them pulling things out, seeing if there's outrage, and what they can get away with. We returned the copy of TurboTax we'd purchased and I'm going to give HR Block's TaxCut a try this year. Guess what, if it works out I'm going to keep using it! If not, maybe I go back to TurboTax, but only if I can't find another one that will work. Stupid, stupid, stupid decision Turbotax.

180,R2DHHLU2PERTXN,"DOUBLE BAIT AND SWITCH!!!!!","DOUBLE BAIT AND SWITCH!!! I have been using TurboTax Deluxe for at least 15 years filing both Schedule C (business income) and Schedule D (capital gains) without any problem. After purchasing the same product this year, I just learned that the Deluxe version no longer can be used to file Schedules C and D. A January 17, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal described the situation and quoted a TurboTax representative as saying that customers could call 800-445-1875 and ""we will work with them on a case-by-case basis."" So I called and after a long wait, they called back. The representative was very nice and offered a refund or a free upgrade to the Premier version. I took the upgrade but it took a great deal of hold time to get the system worked out. After completing the upgrade, I noted that the Premier version does not allow filing a Schedule C. I need the Home & Business version. So, I feel I have been double bait and switched. First from Deluxe and now the Premier version. The Wall Street Journal article says that the HR Block Deluxe version allows users to file Schedules C and D. And people who purchased TurboTax Deluxe can get a free download of the HR Block by emailing SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com and providing a proof of purchase for the TurboTax product. I have written them to get the free download. Shame on TurboTax and Intuit."

After reading the reviews it took away certain features that you were able to do in prior years. They took away Schedule C,E, F without telling the consumer. So if customers bought the software and start doing their taxes it tells them to upgrade for $30 more (If you're using Schedule C,E,F). These features does not affect me at all, BUT not telling their customers...is HORRIBLE customer service!!!! I decided not go with them this year for that reason. What else they might take away next year?? ""I don't know""! because, they don't tell us! This year I went with TaxAct, it was a little adjustment because I was so used to TurboTax, but TaxAct has a feature you can import your previous TurboTax files into their software. At first it did not import. After 5 minutes of trying to import the file, it turns out the TurboTax document file name was the issue. My file name has spaces and other characters type words, so I renamed it to TEST and it imported in nicely. I think I'm going to stick with TaxAct (Unless they pull a fast one like TurboTax did) for years to come. These type of software's you don't change often...especially Tax Software's, because we the people don't like changes. TurboTax lost another customer."

Last year was the first time I ever actively traded stocks. I knew TurboTax Deluxe had the ability to handle stock sales and was all set to buy it when I noticed the overwhelmingly poor reviews. After reading quite a few of them I realized Intuit was trying to rip me and many others off by forcing me to upgrade to a program that cost $30 more then Deluxe. Sorry, Intuit, I'm not that gullible. So I spent five minutes reading up on H&R Block and Tax Act and ended up downloading H&R Block Deluxe for a grand total of $34.27. It transferred my TurboTax info from last year without a hitch and I'm off to the races. I haven't got to the investment section yet but don't expect any problems. As for Bob, the Intuit VP of Marketing, I have read your many and feeble defenses as to why Intuit made the changes it did. Malarkey and balderdash, every word of it. I especially chuckled at your debatable claim only around 4% of TurboTax users would have to upgrade. Even if true, let's do some calculations. Last year Intuit sold what, around 20,000,000 copies of TurboTax? 4% of 20,000,000 is 800,000 people. 800,000 people paying $30 more for your little sham game equals $24,000,000. $24,000,000 of potential profit for reducing functionality and scamming your customers? Not the smartest move you ever made."

So this year I'm at Fry's and grab Basic. Get it home and it says EZ and 1040A only. wtf. So I go to the Intuit website and take a quick look at the product comparison and see the Deluxe is now the version with 1040. So without reading any of the finer details I order Deluxe on Amazon because I ASSUME they just moved the old Basic up to Deluxe which is bad enough IMO. Now I'm finding out that Deluxe doesn't even have the most basic of Schedules. Are you kidding me? How can any business executive be foolish enough to think you can make such a massive overhaul (a.k.a. price increase) without a mass exodus in a firestorm of criticism? I see Intuit is offering a free upgrade to help soften the blow of their colossal corporate blunder but I may pass on that and give HR Block a try."

For starters, if you have a question, good luck finding a number, or an e-mail that you can reach them on. I've read some of the reviews here concerning Forms C and D, not really sure if I had to use those before, as I did everything within the software. But as the problem specifically pertaining to me, is that I never liked the $20 fee to file my state tax. Remember when we had to fork money for the Federal filing to until they got sued? Anyways, I've always filed my state tax via paper as it's cheaper for me to print and mail it with tracking number. So, I was trying to file my CA state tax this year, and I can't. Because it has the words ""DO NOT FILE NOT FORM NOT FINAL"" written all over it. That is even with going through the filling section and reviewing it several times to make sure everything was good to go. Hopefully, they read this and let me know how to file via paper..."

This is my third year using TurboTax to file my returns, and I've never had any issues in the past. This year, after trying to E-file my Illinois return, I was given an error. The TurboTax prompt suggested that I call the Intuit customer service line to pay the $20 fee over the phone. I spent the next hour on the phone with Intuit as they searched for my account (again I've been a TurboTax customer for three years running - how can you have 'lost' my account information?!?!?!). Finally, the Customer Service rep got permission from her manager to bill my credit card on the new account she had just created. Since I'd spent an hour of my life on the phone, I requested that she waive the $20 fee. Again, on hold for another 10 minutes. I was told that the fee would be waived, but that the code would come from a follow-up call from the manager. It's been two days, and I still haven't heard from the manager or anyone else in the Intuit Customer Service Department. Unbelievable. I'll never buy another product from Intuit."

Especially in my case with rentals and a small business where premium isn't even enough. Having been a TurboTax customer from 1998-2013, 16 years straight, I have seen price increases from Intuit before. I stayed loyal since Deluxe did everything I need for the myraid of tax issues I have had over the years and at around 40 bucks it was still a reasonable price. To cover all my needs which include Sch C, D, and E, I would have to pay at least 80 this year. Double. H&R block will do all that and state for 20. If you were paying attention, you would have noticed that consumer software has been decreasing in price. It's not even called software anymore thanks to the 'app' revolution. Now that I have used the competitor and they have filled my needs, all they have to do to keep me for the next 15 years is provide a consistently useful service at a fair price.

Imagine my surprise to find out I needed to upgrade to premiere for my one little stock sale. Apparently everyone was buying deluxe and they weren't selling enough of the twice the price premiere! There was a big article in my local paper about this epic fail on the part of Intuit. It said that if you provide H&R Block proof of purchase of TT, they will provide their software for free.

In reality, most homes are sold at a loss, like mine, therefore there are no capital gains. This is a giant RIPOFF.

Way back when TurboTax first came out, I actually enjoyed doing my taxes. They had those little videos with the man and the women that would help explain the tax laws. That was pretty neat. TurboTax began slowly going down hill after that. Now we have expensive software that is infested with up-sells throughout the entire tax preparation process. Looks like I am going to bite the bullet and make the switch to H&R Block Deluxe this year. One thing that convinced me to switch was H&R Block's offer for free software if you purchased TurboTax Deluxe and are not happy with what happened.

And forget about trying to actually contact Intuit to ask how to fix this software issue (and that's after spending countless tries uninstalling/reinstalling/repairing/trying to start new file).

221,R1OEOMMSWOURS9,"Less painful than I thought it would be","After 20 years of being a loyal Intuit customer, I took the time to switch to H&R Block for my taxes this year. Less painful than I thought it would be. Everything imported fine from last year's TT. I did this mostly because I am a 25-year Silicon Valley engineer/entrepreneur and I view this not as clever marketing, but as totally deceptive and fleecing the customer. I've also been forced to upgrade Quicken 4 times in the past 15 years. I will look for an alternative this time if they force me to upgrade Quicken Deluxe 2014 before I am ready. In this day and age of powerful social networking, it is risky for a company to engage in these kinds of deceptive practices as the degree of separation between the company, its customers, and its Board Members is usually pretty low, especially in Silicon Valley."

When my pay is only going up 2 percent a year, when someone tries to slip a 30-40 percent price increase in, they clearly don't want you as a customer. I don't take it personally. Nothing to be done but choose the best of the competing products. Updating Jan. 28. Just filed our taxes with TaxAct online, $20 for federal and state -- includes efiling for both. It's not quite as slick an interface as TurboTax, and the online software is a little slower, but it works. I'm not paying $50 for TurboTax, let alone $100 or whatever they wanted to charge this year. Intuit just got too greedy. It is just not the time to do big price increases in this economy."

I was able to get the full H&R Block Premium and Business for less than what you want to charge for your crippled Deluxe product. You just broke the most basic business commandment: provide your customers with good value. You spend years building a loyal franchise, and you destroy that in just one stroke. Farewell.

The senior editor related his experience of using H&R Block software after 17+ years of TurboTax. He commented that the H&R Block import was flawless and the software was as good as TurboTax. Letâs face it, this is tax software and not rocket science. I sold my Amazon purchased version of TurboTax on eBay and got the H&R Block equivalent for much less money. If you can put up with a different UI (user interface) and a small learning curve, my advice would be to not buy and buy the H&R Block product."

I always purchase through my investment website. I dread having to figure yet something else out. (It's probably not that hard). Like I say, I'm not savvy, but taking away forms that were working to start with because gosh darn they can't figure out how to keep them in Delux (leave things alone) doesn't sound honest to me.

I am sure I'm not alone in my disgust with TT for doing this. Do they think middle class Americans don't need Sched D or the others? Doesn't make sense and seems like a real PR nightmare.

Today (27 Jan 15)...I just kind of stumbled upon this article which completely blew my mind, since Bob clearly indicated something else: Intuit (INTU), the company that makes TurboTax, maintains a database containing users' Social Security numbers, names and other personal data -- even for customers using the desktop version of the software who save their files on their own hard drives. The existence of the database was revealed to users when Intuit set up a website for customers to ask for their $25 refunds from the software price increase. The site requires users to enter their Social Security numbers to get their $25 refunds. That indicates that personal tax data is, indeed, being stored by Intuit. The fact that Intuit is keeping personal data -- even on customers using the desktop version of the software -- is a bit of a surprise to some. Many taxpayers using the desktop version of the popular tax-preparation software thought they were keeping their personal information stored on their PCs -- not on Intuit's servers. [...] So...Bob. You said you couldn't verify past users unless they called (this reply is posted on Amazon) for you to verify users when I suggested simply putting last years disc or using last years Tax Return as verification of a prior purchase could be used. You said Intuit couldn't do that. In fact, you said it would be illegal. Now, it appears you would have known who your past customers were because, if this article is accurate (not saying it is....asking the question).....you already had the information. Either you were less than forthcoming, or as you said...it would be illegal to use past tax returns to do such. Then I see this on my homepage today. I'd like to see an OFFICIAL Intuit response to this either via major news networks, and/or in this forum. Why are you guys holding on to our personal information?"

Here's a message to the Marketing brain trust at Intuit: It probably seemed like a good idea at the Strategy session to profit from a substantial chunk of your more affluent customers by forcing them to pay more than double what they paid in the prior year. And even, guaranteed to make max bonus! I mean, what could go wrong? Well - I guess they figure they don't need the semi-retired or the retired, who are frequently self-employed, have investment income, or both. And, perhaps like me, who would rather not take the time to switch software, who are loyal long-term customers. I've used Turbotax since 1995, every year, four or five returns, and I'm reasonably satisfied with the substantial accuracy of the product. However, I refuse to pay more than double for the same software as I used last year. And there is an alternative: H&R Block's ""Deluxe"" downloadable product. Check it out.

UPDATE: Received the H&R Block software and was very disappointed. All data did not transfer over, print was way too small and I found a flaw in the programing.

Well, even though it does not affect me this year, what about next year? Then TT takes more functionality out of the product - and something I do need. So consumers need to band together and fight these tactics by purchasing another product. I just purchased HR Block 2014 for about $18 cheaper than TT Deluxe with it's limited functionality. Edited 1-9-2015 Just saw this article on the internet by forbes: this is straight from the article. I do not know if it is true or not but it looks like if you purchased TT 2014 Deluxe and are not happy with it - you can contact HR block and get a free version of their deluxe software...but you do have to provide some information and a copy of the TT receipt. So instead of getting the TT 2014 free upgrade - just move over to HR Block. The tt free upgrade is most likely only going to be for one year - then you'll have the same issue with your 2015 returns. Here is a portion of the article: Block is offering dissatisfied TurboTax customers a free download of its Deluxe software, which normally sells for $44.95 and still allows E-filing of Schedules D and C. Gene King, Block's director of communications, says TurboTax purchasers should send an email to SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com containing their name, email and phone number; whether they use a Windows or MAC operating system; and a scan of their store receipt for TurboTax or a copy of the email showing their TurboTax download code. In return, they'll be sent a link good for one free download of H&R Block Deluxe + State.

But this year, your reviews led me to doing my research first, and I have decided to make the switch to H&R Block's software. Instead of giving Intuit my money and then getting the free offer from H&R Block if Turbo Tax does not work for me, I'm just buying H&R Block and skipping TT completely, likely for good!

At the very minimum, there should be an indication on the intuit home page and their turbotax home page as to the status of this free upgrade. But no such status exists there or anywhere else as of 2/2/2015 except his statement here on amazon. Thus the great bulk of TT Deluxe customers are still completely in the dark about the supposed free upgrade that is coming. Additionally, on the turbotax homepage, which includes purchase and download functions for the different versions, they claim they've reduced the prices by $25.00, EXCEPT these versions DO NOT include the state taxes AND it costs and extra $37.00 if you want the state taxes, something that has ALSO been included in the boxed versions for several years.

Today I got an email from ""Sasan Goodarzi and the TurboTax Team, General Manager, Intuit TurboTax"" that was sent to everyone on their mailing list giving a non-apology apology. Their offer to make things right is to give a $25 refund, but with several strings attached, including actually filing 2013 and 2014 with TurboTax, and to apply for this $25 before 11:59 PM PST April 20, 2015. Several problems with this ""offer"": 1. I prepare my taxes with TurboTax as a way of communicating essential information to my accountant, who then uses his own software to file the actual returns. I find this handy to do and it has worked for me. 2. I almost never file by the deadline - I almost always obtain an extension. I am sure others do the same. 3. $25 does not equate to spending what is needed to get the uncrippled version suitable for my needs. Moreover, it is a bother to have to do this. My solution: 1. I actually bought the product from Costco - I will now return it. 2. I will look at alternatives, including just creating a spreadsheet of information for my accountant and leave it at that.

I have registered and provided my e-mail many times over the years, and yet nothing was received from Intuit as a heads up to the changes.

I thought he was crazy or at least he didn't know what he was talking about, I have used it for many years and even do my children's taxes every year. Just to be safe, I but it back and went home straight to my computer. I STILL COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. After reading all the reviews here on Amazon I finally convinced myself that they had violated my trust. As soon as I finish this review, I will return to Sam's to see if they sell H&R Block. I never really paid any attention as to what others there were to chose from as I was a life-long, extremely loyal, TurboTax user. That ended today! I wish them well as they try and force their loyal user base into into paying twice as much for the features as the Deluxe plus the other stuff they no not need. I guess if they charge twice as much for the same functionality and lose half their customers, they break even. Time will tell as people vote with their wallets. I vote ""no""."

Well, today is the 7th and when I try to upgrade it still tries to get me to enter credit card info so they can charge me. They lied.

This marketing fiasco reminds me of the New Coke days - for those of you not old enough to remember, Coca Cola once thought it was a good idea to replace something everyone loved with something nobody loved. Like most companies, such a pricing decision cannot be made without an impact/ benefit analysis. It is clear that after the numbers were crunched, TT product management decided alienating what they call a ""small segment"" of their customer base was an acceptable risk to justify this pricing / packaging change. It is also clear that their statement of ""listening to our customers"" is not the complete truth, it's more like ""listening to our customers (depending which segment they reside in)"". TT could take a page out of Amazon's playbook where customer loyalty is a key factor in their business decisions. I cannot state how many times Amazon has gone out of their way to resolve my issues by doing what was best to keep me as a loyal customer, even if Amazon lost some revenue as a result. Even with their recent offers of rebates / free upgrades, I remain unconvinced if TT is serious about adopting a culture of truly putting customers first."

So ultimately they are getting the customers to pay the increased fee like they wanted in the first place. Incredible. Good bye TT, hello H&R. Way cheaper and it imports old TT files. Very sad that TT is treating their customers like this."

I am returning the copy I just purchased and making the switch to TaxAct. And to be honest, the email attempt from Intuit's TurboTax General Manager indicating ""we made a mistake..."" is almost as annoying to me as their claimed ""mistake"". They attempted to take advantage of their loyal user base by doing this (as changing tax software comes at a significant time/effort cost), and now that reviews and other public forums have called them out quite appropriately. And now they are trying to act like they're good corporate citizens, which is rather insulting. It's as if someone who got caught trying to steal a candy bar all of a sudden saying, ""... sorry I made a mistake"". All he really means is, I'm sorry we got caught and so publicly called out and humiliated for it. And if social media and other avenues didn't exist, believe me the ""apology for a mistake"" would never have come out. TurboTax dominates this market and they should have stuck with their initial business model. They got greedy and tried to take advantage of their user base. For that, goodbye TurboTax, I am no longer one of your faithful users...."

I've used TurboTax as long as I can remember. The screenshot I've attached to this seems to have disappeared but when you get to the investment income section it forces you to make a decision on upgrading. So you have a choice - you can pay an extra $30 bucks to upgrade, you can beg Turbotax to give you the premiere version or you can return the software and switch to H&R block or another competitor for less than the cost of the upgrade by itself. Incredibly stupid management decisions should never be rewarded and I should not have to beg for an upgrade. Plus the spin on this ""consistency"" thing is laughable (they said they did this to be consistent across their platforms...really!). Inuit obviously thinks their customer base is highly gullible. This ""deluxe"" software is being returned and H&R Block is getting my money this year... and probably next year and probably the year after that."

This year I came out to Amazon to once again buy Turbotax, but after looking at what is happening, I decided this year I would finally make the switch. I bought the H&R Block product, downloaded and installed, and imported my last year's TT file. So far everything is looking good. Been using TT since the mid-90's but not anymore."

If you are able to easily move from TurboTax, than take advantage of that and switch now before you get locked in and it becomes more complicated to switch. And don't forget that Intuit has lobbied Congress in the past to kill any chance of simplified IRS tax filing.

What kind of fools do you take us for? There is only so much we customers will take before you lose our loyalty and respect. For the last several years, I have noticed an increasing amount of shenanigans with your TurboTax product. This is the last straw for me. Just stop the commenting. The correct course of action is to just raise the prices on your products. Don't force customers to upgrade in order to get the features they were expecting and had used in previous versions."

Fine, so I filled out my tax return and went to file. Suddenly Tubotax has decided I'm no longer paying $30 some odd dollars, but instead they want to charge me almost $80. In the past, Turbotax used to let you know when a form you were filling out would mean an upgrade - early on. Now, they seem to allow you to fill it out, and don't tell you until you are about to file that OOPS - you need to upgrade. That will cost you triple what you thought you were going to pay. Turbotax, you're new ways suck. You are driving away customers. All we ask is for you to be up front and honest with us. I want to know early on if I will need to upgrade to a more expensive edition. NOT after I just spent 2-3 hrs of my valuable time inputting everything. I also don't appreciate the fact that Deluxe no longer handles all the types of schedules they did last year. That seems like a bait and switch to your loyal customers. Decide Turbotax. You want to screw your customers and end up with less customers, losing the ones you have had for years?

I was about to order it at Amazon and was vastly surprised at all the massive negative reviews. So I started reading - WOW - I am glad I did. A big thanks to Amazon for allowing individuals to post. I need the missing schedules and I will not pay 2x more for them as they have always been included in the past product. I hope that the power of the Internet will convince TurboTax that they made a big mistake and are losing customers. I will start to research other options.

288,R23VUTL5APRFXH,"First they stop including long-standing features while acting like they made ""upgrades"" to the software","Intuit really outdid themselves in their sketchiness. First they stop including long-standing features while acting like they made ""upgrades"" to the software. Next, they try to blow off complaints. Third, they try to offer a refund that doesn't actually cover the cost of the upgrade, even when they know exactly how much people paid for them. (Case in point: I paid about $33 to Intuit, directly to them through their website, so saying $25 is the average upgrade cost is hardly honest). Lastly.. after people complain even more, they offer a free upgrade. Note that it's only after people complained and they realized they were going to lose business. At this point,their apology doesn't mean anything, since you know they'll just be eyeing another way to gouge you in the future. Luckily, I took up H&R Block's offer to get their free software, so I look forward to comparing it for this year's return, and saying bye bye to Intuit next year. Good job Intuit. It doesn't take much ""Intuit-ion"" to realize that giving the middle finger to your loyal, trusting customers is a poor way to keep them coming back."

I suppose this year we will both begrudgingly be switching to H&R Block, since the Intuit decision was made to pull the rug out from under so many users without just admitting they were forcing a revenue stream into their coffers. I'm guessing from the outpouring of disgust via Amazon feedback many long term customers such as myself are indeed going elsewhere, so perhaps that Intuit income stream will not be so lucrative! There's still time to reverse your course of action Bob---surely you can understand the pain at our end....many will not be forced to Premium for more $$!"

I have been using turbo tax for about 15 years and although I was never 100% satisfied it at least got the job done. I felt ""stuck"" because it imported my taxes from previous years, and with the investments we have and the mortgage and daycare, etc. this software did a good enough job that I just accepted the annual $50 + $20 to e-file. It is a rip-off having to re-purchase software every damn year for a 1 use scenario, but I guess our government is more to blame for that. It is just a cost I accepted with a small dose of anger each year but what can you do? It is what it is. And then, I saw all of the 1 star reviews this year. I really rely upon and trust amazon reviews. If this many people are angry, then something is definitely wrong. Learning that deluxe no longer allows schedules C, D, etc. is a deal breaker for me. Big time. And learning that HR Block will import last year's tax form easily and is cheaper to boot is great news. So... I'm actually happy. I finally have a great reason to switch from Turbo Tax to a cheaper alternative. I'm SO GLAD that everyone voiced their opinion. You guys saved me so much time and hassle figuring this out for myself. Taxes suck enough as it is, if Intuit decided to make it harder this year then screw them. I'm switching. 15 year customer.

(Just sayin) Bottom line: Used TurboTax every year since 1997, Deluxe as far back as I can recall but at least 10+ years. Putrid attempt by Sasan Goodarzi to ""make it up"" to their loyal customers by offering an after-tax-submission $25 rebate off their $74.99 purchase price of Premier. Instead of taking this *fantastic* one-time offer, I purchased H&R Block Deluxe for a whopping $34.34 from Amazon - free shipping. Installed in less than 10 minutes, including the download and installation of an update. Was able to use both Schedule C and Schedule D (included in the Deluxe version - amazing!). The software is easy to navigate and, just as TurboTax previously did, helped me select the most advantageous education deduction. Helped both my kids do their taxes and took advantage of the free e-file for all 3 returns (up to 5 free with the Deluxe edition). Intuit will have to step it up.

They have, however, survived and, in a way, thrived unfortunately. The public needs to take a stand when this crap happens. When we turn a blind eye to these actions we encourage them. I bought their software every year-never a thought. Now, they have taken the low road seeking not customer loyalty but profit. Their brain trust has determined that after losing a certain percent of customers, they will make - no, exceed previous profits. We, the public, just hand it over to them on a silver platter.

Paid about 30 claims total for the H&R Block software, which was about half of what i would have paid for TurboTax. My download of H&R Block Deluxe + State transferred my electronic data from the prior year TurboTax file flawlessly and you know what, H&R Block Deluxe is just as easy to use and understand as TurboTax (with the added bonus of H&R Block Deluxe not trying to constantly upsell me on audit review services, etc.). My H&R Block Deluxe download comes with one state for free and 5 free Federal e-files. Perfect! I honestly never thought about switching because i never had a reason to.

I don't mind a small price increase, but intentionally crippling a product that previously met my needs and forcing customers to move up to higher priced products is very poor customer treatment. They must be thinking that there will be a small percentage of customers who complain and leave but that they will more than make up for the defections with a huge price increase paid by others. As Intuit's marketing VP suggested, I called Intuit to see how they would ""work with customers"" in my situation. They offered a one-time price reduction if you purchase the 2014 software directly from them, but made it clear that in future years, there would be no change or price concession. I am so disappointed with Intuit that I will not use TurboTax for 2014. I will only consider TurboTax in future years if there are enough people who respond like me and this causes them to re-evaluate their practices and customer treatment in future years.

304,R31YF4GCWVKOAU,"A calculation by Intuit that was a huge miscalculation! How did the management buy this dumb idea?","For years I have been using TTAX, even from the very first year when it was called Chipsoft. The program was a lifesavor and worked well and was improved over the years. Intuit then bought the product from Chipsoft and they did OK with it for years. The product became more bloated and slower and also some great features were added. Unfortunately over the years it become more expensive and HR Block taht used be very inferior product also caught up and surpassed TTAX in my opinion and grabbed increasingly bigger share of the market by better and smarter packaging their products and features. You can buy their Home and business that includes their Deluxe home version that has all the schedules for most people including small businesses and then a separate Business version that can handle Partnership, LLC and Corporations and often time can bought on sale here at Amazon for less than $50. Intuit as a company calculated that they could quietly remove the features that made their Deluxe version a very good package for most people, hoping people then would be forced to upgrade so that they could even make more money. As it turned out that calculation turned out to be a huge miscalculation and they lost goodwill and loyalty of thousand or perhaps millions. I am shaking my head and wonder who was the genius behind all this gross stupidity or miscalculation. Intuit used to be a great company that was creative and agile and had a superb customer service. Their success and perhaps change of leadership has blinded them as often is the case. They have alienated their customer with arrogance and stupidity combined and had the gull to write to many customers explaining their rationale and why this was a great thing to streamline and differentiate product and they further aggravated their customers by only taking responsibility for not communicating these wonderful changes. Let's call spade, spade. They gutted a great prodcut and made it almost the same as the free version and kep the name and logo the same as ever and then wrote us and told us that a great accomplishment. They do get some credit, to finally realizing the error of their ways and after the mass exodu, huge revolt in their customer base and loss of much sales, they did what they should have done immediately. As of Feb. 7, whne you buy the deluxe you will automatically get upgraded to the Premier or Home and business for free and they have apologized and promised not to do it again and for next year the Deluxe version will be the same robust program as always with the form s and schedules previously available and supported and hopefully, the same price point. In my opinion, they will need something more dramatic, like free state efiling included or other things to regain their customers. I am so amazed how a bunch of smart businessmen and managers could concoct stupid ideas and have it to be approved through all channels in these large companies. Now, suddenly, the VP wakes up and apologizes and acknowledges their mistakes and offering a concrete solution. I already bought HR Block Home and Business from Amazon at a great price and stayed away from TTAX."

That's on the top of $50 I already paid, and additional $20 was willing to pay for the State e-filing. I consider this extortion! Famous gangster, Tony Soprano, would be proud of you, Intuit! Update on Jan. 2, 2015. After blowing my steam during my first write-up, I contacted Amazon and requested a refund for TurboTax Deluxe.

Surprise! The functionality has been gutted. Won't work for me. Product should have had a warning label: ""Caution, this product is not as good as last year and functionality has been significantly diminished."" Called customer service and was promised free upgrade. After 20 minutes of screwing around trying to set up a download of the upgrade, the customer service rep had to put me on hold to talk to an Apple guy. After 10 minutes of holding I decided that it wasn't worth it. All I wanted is the ability to use the forms not all of the fluff that goes with the upgrades. Why would you screw with established customers? This is one of those incredibly stupid decisions that gets executives fired."

So, I downloaded H&R Block Premium from Amazon and I am happy to report it is very easy and very satisfying to use. For those of you looking for a quality replacement to TT, the H&R product is excellent, especially when one considers the under $40 price tag. All the schedules you want are fully supported without tricks, gimmicks, or embedded sales pitches to buy more expensive software.

Even with the Amazon Prime 10% offer, I just can't give in to the Turbo Tax extortion anymore. They duped me last year when I had to upgrade to Premier, which you don't find out until after you've purchased that you will have to do, after you're already invested. I almost dumped them then in protest, and started to pop extra to start over with H&R, but didn't. Now, enough is enough. I've been a loyal Turbo Tax customer since 1995. 2014 begins a new era for me in tax preparation software. H&R Block seems to offer the value that meets customer expectations for their base products. I understand that there is a point where they have to require a different model for customers. But Turbo Tax used to be rational about the forms and schedules one might need in their Deluxe product. I think they have abandoned a lot more customers than they realize. And now this one is abandoning them. It's their right to do what they feel they must and it's my right to walk away from their products. Just understand, it's because they have stripped the quality and level of appreciation that I expect and deserve. As long as I can find what I expect elsewhere, Turbo Tax will not get my business back because they have basically said that they don't care about whatever category they have me in as much as they do others.

And then talking to us like we're all card carrying members of the Moron Nation. I'll be looking at competitive products to see if they can fill the void this year. Worst case will be if I have to purchase the Premium package this year and have a year to figure out how to dump Intuit by next year.

I noted the rather convoluted 2014 âbrandingâ change (Deductions and Homeowners), but naively assumed the same core functionality as it was subtitled Deluxe. To my surprise and consternation, imbedded in the âfine print,â was the deletion of significant needed functionality and forms. Infuriating! I have never had a software vendor raise prices by disabling functionality in order to force an upgrade. I was tempted to purchase an alternate tax program, but to avoid relearning a new application this close to tax time, I dutifully returned Deluxe and purchased Premier (Investments and Rental Property). Intuit got their extra money, but I come away from this experience with deep reservations about the integrity of the company and, obviously, wonder what surprises are in store for us next year."

In spite of some annoying interface changes over the years, and in spite of having to pay full-price for basically the same program every year, it's been worth it because of how much easier it is to do my taxes, especially Schedules C and D which I find too complicated to deal with manually. After reading the condescending and disingenuous email I received from them, about how great their new product design is even though it basically doubles my cost (as I'd now need the Home and Business version to replace what they dropped from Deluxe - note it still has sched. C but it's limited to a ridiculous $100 of expenses, while D is totally gone), and about how us customers just don't quite get why the changes are so great so they'll throw us a $25 bone (plus extra hassle to get it) to help us adjust to the new ways, I've decided to completely ditch the software out of general principle and try a competitor's offering. If the managers at turbotax had simply been honest, and either charged a few bucks more for Deluxe, or changed the name from Deluxe to Basic (and Basic down to Primitive or whatever), then I would have gone along just to keep my system the same as I've done for ten years. But this whole sneaky and confusing and greedy change affecting hordes of long-time customers like me, has completely turned me off to the company."

In my case the alternative was to use TuboTax and either manually fill out my own unsupported 1040 Schedules and file with the IRS via mail or pay an additional 30 USD. Neither was a option for me. Intuit's greed and positioning/baiting the customer (me) into this situation the CEO of Intuit Brad Smith should be ousted when a comparison of year-to-year sales is tabulated between tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016.

We thought we'd be able to force you fools that's been buying our TT Deluxe for 20 years to pay us another $30 or so for the same package you bought last year by forcing you to ""upgrade"" (i.e. stay the same) to Premier. That would have been $30 profit clear and free above since the cost to us was the same. I thought I'd look like a profit guru and would collect millions in bonuses.

No opportunity to override and forge ahead without TurboTax assistance. Just a dead stop in the middle of tax preps. I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing, but I, like many, have trusted TurboTax in the past and felt like I could continue to order the same product level I have in the past, without the need to read reviews. I knew your product and was comfortable with it. More importantly, I knew your reputation. Clearly, I was wrong. What I see now is a shady attempt to squeeze more money from your loyal and new customers. Epic Fail. You'll note the chart provided on Amazon lists Sch C on the Deluxe features (with a caveat of ""limited""), so the response that you are now providing the countless customers who are posting negative reviews with the same complaints amounts to nothing but lame excuses.

I have used TurboTax continuously since 1992 when it was made by Chip Soft. I have even met Bob Meighan, the VP who has fielded all the negative comments. (Or at least I am pretty sure I did at a TurboTax Inner Circle meeting in Washington DC a few years ago). My disillusionment began when TurboTax dumped the Inner Circle.I guess Intuit figured out they knew their customers' preferences without the Inner Circle. Judging by the low ratings, this looks like a mistake. I think Intuit simply found a segment of the population that could afford to pay more and they decided to milk it. After all, with Quicken, Mint, and TurboTax who knows more about personal financial habits than Intuit? Who is this segment? We are older, have some investments, beginning retirement, and probably made some capital gains. We also don't understand multiple platforms (heck, one is enough to master). Further, while we pay tens of thousands in taxes, give thousands to charity, we still like to get a bargain by purchasing TurboTax at Amazon or Costco. This would not surprise any behavioral economist. Not surprisingly, this segment also includes the real long time, loyal, consistent TurboTax users. I would not have minded it a bit if the price went up $5 or so for all the versions, but the idea of a forced switch of products after 20 years is a low blow. What I find most incredible is the alienation of long standing customers. Most businesses value customer loyalty more than anything. Can you imagine having millions of customers returning each year.and now handing them off to the competitor. H&R Block is reacting aggressively to get TurboTax customers, and it doesn't seem to upset Intuit. One day someone will write a great business school case study on this.

347,R3162HYSZW0WQD,Disgusted,"Is it possible to give 0 stars? I'm disgusted with Intuit for removing functionality that we've grown to depend on. This is little more than contrived market manipulation in order to prop up Intuit's sagging margins. Sadly, Intuit used to innovate - now they manipulate. I've emailed them, and explained that in one week I begin my tax preparations. If I don't have a suitable answer by then, I'll move to another product permanently. How's that change working out for you, Bob?"
348,R1JQDGJPVVGJN0,"TaxAct & H&R Block Deluxe Tax program are both as easy to complete taxes as TurboTax","February 18, 2015 Update: YIPPEE, today my 2014 tax return preparation is completed, was done easily at home on my PC, and was COMPLETELY FREE using TaxAct. Today I finished my 2014 tax return on my PC using the FREE downloadable TaxAct program, eFiled my Federal return for FREE with TaxAct, and my return was approved by the IRS within a couple of minutes. I have to thank TurboTax again for the 2014 TurboTax Deluxe debacle, as my eyes were opened, and I tried alternative tax prep programs for the first time in over 30 years of loyally using TurboTax to file my taxes. I discovered the tax refund amounts were identical as with TurboTax, and that completing my taxes with TaxAct were just as easy as with TurboTax. I will NEVER USE TurboTax again, and still have the convenience of doing my taxes at home on my PC, and eFiling with TaxAct for FREE. As a long time user of TurboTax since the 1980s, and a long time user of Quicken, I have been a loyal customer of Intuit. This year all of that has changed. While I purchase many items from Amazon and am an Amazon Prime customer, I usually buy my TurboTax from Costco, since it is so close to where we live, and I did so again this year. I was outraged when I installed TurboTax Deluxe and got the message that I needed to upgrade to TurboTax Premier. Even though I had opened and installed TurboTax Deluxe, I took it back to Costco and got a refund no questions asked. I then purchased TurboTax Premier, and was very disappointed in the greedy corporate ripoff to get more revenue by crippling their software. The more I thought about it, the madder I got. Intuit has done something similar with their Quicken products by requiring the purchase of a new Quicken version every few years to maintain the ability to download stock updates using Quicken. This move to cripple TurboTax Deluxe was the straw that broke the camel's back. I took advantage of H&R Block's free tax program for purchasers of TurboTax Deluxe and downloaded their free H&R Block Deluxe Program. I also downloaded and installed TaxAct software for free. I then entered my tax data in TurboTax Premier, the free H&R Block Deluxe Program, as well as in TaxAct. Both the H&R Block Deluxe and TaxAct were able to import TurboTax previous year's tax data, offered Taxpayer interview questions, and were every bit as easy to complete ones' taxes as TurboTax was. Since H&R Block is way cheaper, and TaxAct offers a completely free tax program, supporting all tax forms as well as including a free Federal eFiling, and TaxAct State eFiling only costing about $12.00, or a Deluxe TaxAct Package for about $20.00 including both Federal eFiling and State Efiling, I have switched to TaxAct for my eFiling. So even if I were to be able to continue using TurboTax Deluxe as in previous years, it still costs almost twice as much as other Tax Preparation software programs such as H&R Block, and TaxAct. Since I live in Texas and don't need a State tax eFiling, the cost of me doing my tax returns with TaxAct is now COMPLETELY FREE. Also, I took my opened TurboTax Premier program back to Costco, and got a full refund on TurboTax, no questions asked. Good Bye forever Intuit. Also,if one is an Android user, and possibly an iPhone user, anMoney offers a great financial app for tablets, smart phones, etc, that offers much the same capability as Quicken Mobile. So because of Intuit's greed over wanting to bait and switch customers with TurboTax Deluxe this year, they not only are losing me as a customer this year, but forever, I know many others are not only dumping TurboTax but also dumping Quicken and Quicken Mobile for cheaper more versatile financial software like anMoney.So Intuit is facing a double whammie over their corporate greed, losing both Quicken and TurboTax loyal customers of 20 -30 years. I hope Intuit enjoys their short lived attempt to get more money from their loyal customers, as it seems to have backfired and many customers saying goodbye to Intuit for good. 01/30/15 Update: I forgot to mention in my initial review that in addition to all 3 tax prep programs (TurboTax Deluxe & TurboTax Premier, H&R Block Tax, and TaxAct free version) being equally easy to use, for my 2014 Federal tax return data, the CALCULATED TAX AMOUNT & REFUND AMOUNTS WERE IDENTICAL in each of the tax prep programs that I entered my tax data to compare the programs calculation capabilities and accuracy. With identical tax calculations across all of the 3 most popular tax prep programs, it makes no sense for me to continue to use TurboTax and pay twice as much or more for getting the same results with the same ease of data entry with alternative manufacturer's tax prep programs. Also, when I returned my TurboTax programs to Costco for a refund, I apologized for any inconvenience, and was informed that all of the TurboTax programs that were refunded were being sent back to TurboTax so Costco doesn't lose money with unusable TurboTax returned tax programs, which was good to know since Costco should not be penalized over TurboTax's corporate greed costing them unusable inventory problems. 01/31/15 Update: Since TurboTax saw fit to try and do such a money grab on its long time loyal customers of Intuit products, specifically requiring expensive upgrades to file ones taxes via eFiling if their tax situation used certain forms, I thought it might be of interest to see just how much the powers that be at Intuit are paid. So I did some research, and went to this web site, http://www1.salary.com/Brad-D-Smith-Salary-Bonus-Stock-Options-for-INTUIT-INC.html , salary.com, which shows that As President and Chief Executive Officer at INTUIT INC, Brad D. Smith made $16,548,469 in total compensation for 2014. Also the above website shows that As Senior Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Tax Group at INTUIT INC, Sasan K. Goodarzi made $5,639,023 in total compensation in 2014. Everyone can draw their own conclusions about such executive salaries, but such salaries have to come from somewhere, namely on the backs of customers that purchase Intuit products, that I don't intend to use in the future after 30 plus years as a loyal TurboTax user. Thanks to TurboTax this year, for opening my eyes and motivating me to explore alternative Tax Programs from other corporations that work as well as TurboTax, and financial programs that cost less and do the job just as well as Quicken does. Thanks again, TurboTax, and GOODBYE FOREVER"

Yes, I know I can buy the Premier version this year and call the 800 number for a ""free"" upgrade to Home & Business, but I want to join the others in sending TT a loud message- YOU'RE LOSING LOYAL CUSTOMERS WITH THIS YEAR'S CHANGES.

Many long-time users report switching to H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe, which supports these Schedules and imports data from prior year TurboTax files--all at a lower price. In response to pervasive customer dissatisfaction, Intuit temporarily provided free upgrades from Deluxe to Premier version.

After e-filing the 2014 return, customers can submit online refund applications at www dot turbotax dot com slash 25back. The application for refund must be submitted by April 20th. 2.

Setting aside the lost ""deluxe"" feature, had I known Premier was required, it would have been cheaper to buy Premier initially. I was not aware of the change, so now I'm stuck paying the penalty upgrade. Fortunately, H&R block is offering a FREE download to those that have already purchased TT Deluxe.

I have noticed that they have been incrementally raising prices every year, sometime by reducing/eliminating discounts. This is the final nail in the coffin for them from my perspective. I have purchased both the products for current year but have not opened them. I will return both and switch to competitor products for good.

Like many others, I was incensed by the feature reduction that was accompanied by a price increase. The ""justification"" written by the VP from Intuit only compounded my negative feelings. I applaud the folks that submitted early reviews that saved me from making an unwise decision. Loyalty to a product works in both directions.. from the consumers AND the providers. I think Intuit made a very poor business decision as far as retaining their customer base. I'm sure most people in business would agree that retaining a customer should be easier that getting a new one.

No way am I going to put myself through the anger and torture of buying a once valued product only to be bitten in the butt by it. Thanks to all customers who actually purchased the product, were swindled, and then spent the time to warn the rest of us. And for your wasted $ I am sorry. But in the end you will win because Intuit will lose its loyal customer base.

My tax circumstances have not changed, nor are they more complicated than previous years, so why should I have to add $40 to my tax preparation fees for one small, rather minor stream of income that just happens to have costs associated with it? I could continue with TT and just decide to forego the possible reduction in my tax bill, or I could decide to take up H&R block on their offer of a free copy of their Deluxe version, which will allow me to do all that I need to do. As any right-minded person would do, I am taking the H&R route. It will be interesting to see whether the loss of customers like me from TT will be compensated for by the increase in revenue from those who elect to stay and pay the extra fees. An addendum: Intuit announced that beginning today (1/23), it will issue $25 refunds to ""customers forced to buy the most expensive version of the company's software this year after buying the less-costly Deluxe version last year"" ([...]). Yippee, now I only have to pay an extra $15 for the same functionality as last year's version, or I still move to H&R. It's an easy decision - why would I pay more for less?"

A fair increase in price is understandable, but what TT has done is disgusting. They have removed previously available option in Deluxe and made them part of Premier and essentially claims we're the stupid ones for not reading the fine print. It doesn't matter what the print reads. How the heck can you remove a steering wheel from a car and tell me I must pay more if I want a car with the steering wheel? This is some corporate finance strategist drawing up more ways to make money, while ripping off loyal customers. For the first time in many, many years, I'm looking elsewhere to file my taxes and I hope you will make a statement by doing the same. Do the extra work now, and you'll be happy later. Stay with TT and you are sure to get screwed over time and again."

During a telephone call with a Turbotax representative I was offered a free download for the Premier version.This experience definitely encourages me to investigate features and price of other tax software in the future. Turbotax states that the change was made to make online and retail-purchased versions the same. Seems that a customer focused company would have made the online version identical to the retail-purchased version and maximize customer satisfaction, rather than implement a change that attempted to maximize profits."

I did not need them to ""walk me through"" the questions about self-employment income and expenses. But it was a little harder to find the Schedule C form and supporting documents this year, but I did, and filled them out as needed. But today, when I went to complete and submit my ""Free"" E-File"" I was told that my return ""Contained forms which were unsupported by this version of Turbo Tax"". Bullcrap! Of course they then wanted me to upgrade for another $40 (oh, thanks, you have been forced to send all of your angry defrauded customers a ""cash refund"" of $25 - it would be sent after I file - hah - no doubt a coupon for next year!). Well - I had discarded my packaging with the serial number on it after the program loaded well without problems! So I was not even allowed to fall for this extortion! So - now I have to print my files and mail them - and to add insult to injury my wife is out of town and so I will have to wait a week for her signature on the paper returns.

Yes, I've gotten used to Intuit's attempted up-selling in the past, which has always been benign. This time however is different. In a panic, I purchased the $30 upgrade for Premier. Yes, I read Intuit's explanation, which basically says: Yes, you've been ordering a Big Mac for the past 10 years, but your bad for not reading the ingredients which states that the patty is now sold separate! What makes me feel that Intuit's intentions are NOT IN GOOD FAITH is the WEASEL WORDING it uses to describe the changes: ""We've made some changes this year to give you the best possible experience..."". This wording sounds like an upgrade to me. EXACTLY WHERE IN THAT STATEMENT does it EXPLICITY SAY that the product has actually been GUTTED??? The money is one thing, but nobody likes to BE RIPPED OFF. I acted in good faith by purchasing this product faithfully just like I've done for almost 20 years. I don't think my expectations were out of line since the product title was exactly the same and lacked any disclaimers.

Not an overly complicated return but I certainly need the schedules that have been part of the Deluxe package in the past. I'm just glad I saw these reviews(read everyone of them) prior to purchasing as I'm sure I would have made the same mistake many have made....saw ""Deluxe"" and purchased. If your going to strip that much functionality from a product then you can't keep the same name. When you buy the same product year after year you really don't expect to have to read through a bunch of marketing garbage to figure out what your getting. I'm glad to hear that H&R Deluxe will import my old returns as that's where I'm headed. Loyal customer lost. P.S.

The software has handled ""most"" stuff and the interview style is useful for doing taxes in semi-brain dead mode. If they wanted to ""bring everything into sync"", they should have done it in the customer's favor and with a clear and upfront announcement, instead of bungling the change so badly. This has opened the door for me to somewhat reluctantly take H&R Block up on its free tax software offer, assuming it handles Schedule D, stock transaction imports, Limited Partnerships and auto-filing with no problems. I'll do the taxes a little earlier then normal in case I run into problems; if I do, my fallback position is to try and get the free upgrade from Turbotax and redo the taxes with that. For the future though, I'll be looking for a TT replacement, whether it be H&R or something else. Edit: Not changing my review but received this in my email, from TT: ""Because you are a loyal TurboTax Advantage member, if while preparing your return, your tax situation requires any of the forms listed above, you will automatically be upgraded for free into the product that's right for you.""

Additionally, taxes are something I don't like to think about all year so I do not want them sending me offers and emails all year. I have been aware of free services for several years but did not make the change out of convenience and fear of change. On-the-other-hand, I almost had a heart attack last night after I had spent considerable time doing my taxes and I received a message that the program I was using was no longer capable of doing my very simple tax return. They were charging me 30 dollars more to upgrade to a new version. Certainly they didn't tell me that when I paid my annual 50 dollars for the same product I had always used. Once again they were trying to gouge me. Every year I felt it was a little excessive when they charged me 25-30 dollars extra to download another state's form so I could do my mother's taxes. I thought it a little excessive when I paid around 25 dollars each to file my state return and my mother's. This year's added fee was just too much. In the entire tax year (2014) I only traded one stock, one time. I bought 100 shares at a certain price and I sold 100 shares at a certain price. Not rocket science. I know when I bought it, what price I paid for it, and when I sold it. They seriously want to charge me 30 dollars for that simplistic transaction? The truth is the 30 dollars is not an issue. The issue is that they want me to download and install an entire new program for this one tiny transaction, knowing full well that if I download it I will spend an additional hour or two answering even more stupid, unrelated questions about my financial planning and investing that I have no desire or need to answer. There are years when I have had very complex tax returns and there are years like this year where they are amazingly simple. I have one income, one mortgage, no interest income, very little investment income, and very few deductions. I should be able to do this return on a cocktail napkin, but with Turbo Tax it is a very long arduous task of downloading specific versions and asking a million questions that have nothing to do with me as an individual. And now they want to make it even more detailed and complicated? TaxAct is free, as far as I know, and an article I found on Google ranked it as the second most popular tax program. Articles I read also said HR Block is offering their program free to anyone who switches from Turbo Tax. I guess it is time to make the change. I refuse to pay them 30 dollars to complicate my life. They should be paying me for the distress they have already caused me. I hate returning things, but I feel I will be going back to Costco and telling them the program did not work and asking for my money back."

It is of no use to me now that they have removed the schedule C and D functionality. I called the 800 number posted many times here by the turbotax vp. They simply told me I would need to purchase the premier version for $89.99. I am definitely switching to H&R Block software. As one other reviewer stated, I'm sure there will be a lot of outraged customers who purchase the software not knowing about the change and get stuck in the middle of their return.

But the 2014 changes (Sch D for me) are just too much. For years, I bought Deluxe directly from TT. Every year they would reward my loyalty by sending me a repeat customer offer of an amazing $5 or sometimes even $10 off. I would then waste an hour or so digging around on their site to find a considerably better price offered to the general public. So so arrogant. As a retiree and a buy and hold investor, I really have a pretty simple return. I did have one stock sale last year which requires doing a Form 8949 and a Sch D. I see my options as: 1. Using Deluxe, doing the 8949 and D manually, and adjusting the 1040 accordingly. This would probably preclude e-filling, too. 2. Pony up another $25-$30 for Premium despite the fact that Deluxe is already more expensive than several competing products that will handle my return. 3.

The frustration of having to convert and go to another product is not something I look forward to but since Intuit's forced my hand I will deal. Once converted I see no reason to ever return; I totally understand having to upgrade to a more complex product if my tax situation changed, but it hasn't, and if Turbo Tax can't do it at a comparable cost as their competitors consumers will go elsewhere.

Also I am not impressed with their solution, they are helping people out this year by giving them a rebate that they have to file for after they do their taxes, but this does not help them next year or any year after, big deal! This is how I see it: So in order to file my taxes, I will 1) have to do my taxes with Turbo Tax deluxe, 2) If needed I will have to spend more of my money to upgrade in order to finish doing my taxes. 3) You will then refund me $25.00 after I fill out a form and wait for the rebate, what 4 to 6 weeks? Or I can move to H&R's software that is comparable to Turbo's Deluxe, pay less for it to start with and not have to upgrade to finish doing my taxes, plus no rebate to have to apply for and then have to wait for.

This year, when I was entering my tax information, I found out that they had removed all ability from this product to enter business expenses (I'm certain that I have done this in the past with the same product). The only solution was to upgrade to TurboTax Home and Business to the tune of another $40.

No thanks - and don't bother with the ""contact our sales team to address your price concerns"" response. I've already read it in other people reviews - not buying it (literally).

Since I am running 10.6.8, I'm out of luck, and won't be able to transfer my information from last year. To top it off, the seller (not Amazon) was rude and accused me of wanting free software. Hardly. I asked if there was software for older operating systems, got no answer. As it stands, I'm going to have to go somewhere else to get my tax software.

Turbo Tax has every right to do whatever they choose with their products, but I also have ever right (and intention) to do whatever I wish to with my future tax software purchasing decsions. I thought I had found a ""partner"" in Turbo Tax Deluxe, but aparantly this isn't a ""partnership"" with equal respect. Reading the letter of ""apology"" from Turbo Tax reads like corporate double speak. They are addressing only part of the issue and their reasoning for making the changes is absolutely ludicrous. To eliminate confusion for our customers we take features away from a product that's had their features for many years and make you pay more for an upgraded product ???? Really....you did all that so I (your long time customer) wouldn't be confused ??? Wow....how generous of you ! How does eliminating long time features in existing product reduce my confusion ? You literally can't make this stuff up, but yet it happens ! I found out about this change just days before intending to purchase my Turbo Tax Deluxe product and went ahead and purchased the Premiere version that I will now need. I did this in spite of my anger at this company. I'm not one to make snap decisions when I was literally ready to start my taxes. You can be sure however that in the coming year, I'll be exploring other options, whether it be another company's software product, or some other avenue of filing my taxes. I just wish more corporations understood that it takes years to build up brand loyalty and trust, but it can be destroyed in minutes by a stupid, ill thought out decsion in a boardroom filled with people who either have no clue how the consumer world works, or else are so arrogent that they don't care and think we'll just suck it up and take it......wrong in my case. Can't promise yet, but my guess is that I won't be a Turbo Tax customer next year !

Itâs not as glitzy as TTax and it has some quirks importing from TTax but ultimately it works and has the functionality I need and is significantly less expensive than TTax. So thanks, Intuit, for motivating me to overcome my TTax inertia and explore alternatives. Unfortunately for you, my inertia is now settling on HR Block for next year and beyond so youâve lost me as a TTax customer. But donât worry, I still use Quicken. For nowâ¦"

Now Intuit has decided to force us to pay more for the Premier, and rather than fess up that they just want to squeeze more money out of customers, they offer a lame excuse of produce consistency.

Since they already have my SSN in their database, the goose has been cooked and I might as well go ahead and eat. Really disappointed. I wonder if they have a copy of my Quicken data in case my hard drive crashes? I can just call them up and have them send me a copy of it?? Update 6Feb15: looks like tomorrow I can update to a version that I can do a schedule C on. On a bad note, Intuit had to shut down their state income tax filing servers because of a security breach. Until further notice you can't file your state income tax returns until they resolve the fraudulent activity. I'll give them a pat on the back for seeing the obvious and rectifying their idiot marketing move to line their pockets big time. I guess the CEO saw what Intuit was having to pay E&Y to do his tax return and figured a doubling of the price was great idea.

I paid them my money to do just that--file the state, too, only to THEN have the software inform me, after my money was taken, that the state return cannot be filed electronically, because my state return includes a schedule that TurboTax can't file electronically (Schedule CS/Edvest College Savings Plan). I went back, unchecked the Form/Schedule that was preventing the electronic filing, but the software is still factoring the data entered anyway and won't just ""forget it."" It won't allow anything but paper filing of my state return. Lured into paying more for electronic filing, and then don't allow me to file electronically. I'm so angry. If TurboTax had told me it couldn't file electronically BEFORE I was charged, I would have opted to just use my state's direct, free efile option, instead of getting robbed of $34.99 and having to wait weeks longer to get my state refund."

The GUI is different from TT but the process and content is so similar that the transition to HR Block software has really been effortless and transparent. The HR Block software found the file on my computer and loaded my TT file from 2013 as advertised. I had been a TT user for 10 years since 2005 but they will never get me back. It appears that they have now reduced the TT Premium version (which has the missing Deluxe content) to about $55 but it is still more than $20 higher than the comparable HR Block software with the same 5 federal efiles and one state return and schedules C & D functionality. Intuit really screwed up and now that I am over the fear of making the switch (again, something you shouldn't fear) I am done with them."

Intuit surprises you in the 2014 version. So do not buy the Deluxe version expecting things to be as before. You will get to the point in the program where you want to enter any gains or losses from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. then the 2014 Deluxe program abruptly informs you that you must upgrade to the ""Premiere"" version to have this capability.

In 2013 I had some large end-of-the-year expenses so a large withdrawal from my IRA. I paid a 4th quarter estimated tax payment accordingly. But TurboTax Delux made me pay interest to the IRS because it thought I should have made the payment over the four quarters of 2013. How the hell am I supposed to do that when the withdrawal was at the END of 2013. Given that TurboTax is the most expensive tax preparation software, I would expect it to be the best. It isn't!

There is nothing at all on the website regarding refunds or if/when we can expect the state to accept our returns. The local paper ran a story about 90+ minute wait times on the phone line to attempt to get an answer.

Since they have decided to make a change, I have too. I have switched over to H&R Block this year. Since my taxes aren't done yet it is too early to render a full verdict, but the much lower price for the ""original TurboTax Deluxe"" functionality, the same guarantee and apparently a better customer support structure all suggest that a change is overdue. It was interesting to see Intuit taking ""full responsibility"" for the change. Based on my experience and apparently the experience of a large number of TurboTax users that have commented, they may be taking responsibility for a large drop in their customer base and lots of unhappy people who have been buying TurboTax Deluxe on auto-pilot for many years and now won't be able to complete their taxes without a required upgrade at the last minute.

456,RO5QTNB2L6Z6D,"Beware - Deluxe no longer includes Schedule D - Intuit trying to push people to Premier","I have been a long-time user of TurboTax and a fan of Intuit for many years. I purchased the Deluxe version from Amazon this year as I have done for the last several; however, I just got done writing Intuit and requesting a refund. Some genius at Intuit has decided to try and drive more revenue by removing essential forms (i.e. Schedule D) from the Deluxe version and thereby force users who need that functionality to upgrade to Premier. Rather than actually innovate (what their founder Scott Cook preaches and what made Intuit the dominant provider in areas like tax preparation software, personal financial management, and small business accounting), they have decided it is just easier to try and milk more from captive customers. Migrating to another solution is a pain, but I am willing to do this out of principle. Maybe whatever additional revenue they generate from this scheme will be greater than the lifetime value of a customer like me that they lose, but it also speaks to the state of their ability to continue to add value through innovative products. I realize that tax preparation software may not be ""cutting edge"", but surely they can find ways to offer new and innovative products that would drive revenue rather than try and nickle and dime us. Update post ""offer"" from Intuit: Not sure what Intuit is thinking, but this offer is not remotely close to what they need to do. Aside from the bs explanation that continues to fan the flames (hello to Intuit - this is not a communication issue. Your explanation about keeping the online and desktop version consistent is not fooling anyone. You could have left the forms in the online version to keep them consistent, but everyone knows this was a ploy to push people to spend more on the Premier version), the offer is silly. If I used Deluxe last year and if I was stupid enough to buy Premier, I can wait until I file my taxes and apply for a $25 rebate that will come 6-8 weeks after that. This is Intuit trying to pacify at as little a cost as possible with the hope that they will be able to push people to Premier next year with less push back. They should have offered a rebate to everyone who purchased Premier this year regardless of whether they did so because Deluxe lacked the schedules. How do the people who a long-term premier users feel about not being eligible for this huge $25 rebate? Additionally, the trust is now broken so customers have no faith that Intuit will not try to scam them next year or the year after. These are customers who were like an annuity to Intuit. As long as the product continued to function, we would continue to purchase it year after year. This stunt has pissed off a large number of loyal customers. I am sure Mr. Cook is happy about having Intuit compared to New Coke and Netflix in the history of stupid decisions. I am sure someone thought there would be some unhappy customers, but enough people would blindly pay the additional amount that revenue would grow faster and the GM would be a hero. Not sure if one or more people take a hit for this, but I guess it will depend on the ultimate outcome. Everyone will be happy if revenue grows and the stock price increases; however, the Board should act if this causes a loss of market share or a miss on revenue by removing those responsible."

I was soon informed that I would need to upgrade. I would have bought the H and R Block had they been honest. I won't be in this situation again next year, but it's too late. You have lost me as a customer. It's called DEDUCTIONS AND HOMEOWNERS!!!! Selling is sometimes part of home ownership!!!

I don't understand how they can continue to call it ""Deluxe."" Admittedly the software in past years was easy to use (although very bloated for some reason - a resource hog), but this price gouge is so disappointing that I can't help but give a 1 star review to throw my voice into the sea of unhappiness out there. Hopefully TT will change this policy of stripping features next year, but it will be too late for me. I'm switching to H&R Block software and will likely stay there."

The 2014 version so far has 240 reviews, averaging 2 of 5 stars, with 70% giving it one star. That's a huge problem for Intuit since many reviewers would have given it zero stars if they could. Intuit's desire for ""consistent product functionality across [platforms]"" sounds a lot like Microsoft's Windows 8, which was supposed to give an identical experience across platforms (desktop, laptop, tablet and phone). That worked so well that after a minor update in Windows 8.1, the upcoming version of Windows will be version 10, as Microsoft tries to get consumers to forget about Windows 8. Intuit needs to rename and rebrand ""deluxe."" I've used Turbo Tax Deluxe for so long I can't remember when I used anything else, but I'm done with ""deluxe."" Maybe I'll return, maybe not.

I'm well aware of the need of companies like yours, Intuit, to create on-going revenue streams - but usually when they're this aggressive, there aren't many alternatives. Well guess what - that's just not the case with your products. Just FYI - if you've already purchased TurboTax (and are now kicking yourself for being a loyal customer, and being flogged at the register this year), HR Block will now give you a FREE download of their software, without all of these games.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see this from a company known for lobbying for complex tax rules to keep its products in demand. It's disgusting.

473,RGVFNVG41OS07,"Deja vu of 2013 Web version","I've been using TurboTax desktop for my sole proprietor business since the days it was owned by ChipSoft. Last year, my hard drive crashed shortly before the IRS deadline and I had to resort to the Web based version. That was a disaster. I started off using the deluxe version, as I had always done before. Only when I got to the business section did they tell me I had to upgrade. I tried some work-arounds, like filling out schedule C manually, but it didn't work. And then, when I did upgrade, all the data I had already entered disappeared. At this point, I called TurboTax and got a very nice rep who apologized very sincerely for the problem. She filed a request to the technical team to restore my data, and then, as compensation for my troubles, came me a code that she said I could use when I actually filed that would allow me to pay only the cost of the Deluxe version, regardless of whether or not I used the features of the upgrade. Sounded good to me. But that's not the way it worked out. Although a little bit of what I had previously entered (basically the personal information that doesn't routinely change from year to year) was restored, none of the 2013-specific data I entered was restored and I had to enter it all again. To top that, when I it was time to pay, there was no opportunity to use the discount code the rep gave me. I was very attentive going through the screens, and if there was any way to use it, it was very well hidden. But the lesson I thought I had learned from last year was not to use the Web version. This year, I naively assumed that the desktop version was going to be fine and I went ahead and bought the Deluxe desktop, only to find that Intuit was going through the same bait and switch routine with it this year. I give up on Intuit. They clearly have lost their way."

480,R990ST4LJ0UZT,"After 15 years of using Turbotax, this release has caused me to switch to HR Block","With new releases, who takes away features rather than adding to remain competitive? Intuit Turbotax apparently. After 15 years of using TurboTax, I too will be switching to H&R Block. Turbotax has always found small ways to gouge you (extra charge for state e-file, hidden fees, etc...), but I always sucked it up and just kept using them out of convenience. After reading the reviews, it looks like Intuit has taking gouging to a new level, by actually taking out the Deluxe features but still calling it 'Deluxe'. So incredibly dishonest and unethical. Their strategy is to prey on the uneducated who will buy Deluxe thinking its the same as it has been in past years. Then when in the middle of their returns, when features they need aren't there, Intuit will require them to upgrade within the app (charging significantly more for the upgrade than if they would have bought the higher version originally). So sneaky, shady, and unethical. I will be switching over to HR Block Deluxe, and encouraging all my extended family and friends to do the same. HR Block Deluxe is getting almost 5 star ratings on Amazon, and even imports your 2013 return from Turbotax (making for an easy transition). I also now feel HR Block is a more transparent and reputable company. Turbotax is preying on the ignorant, removing features to nickel and dime people in to last minute add ons. With HR Block, at least what you see is what you get. Due to Turbotax getting greedy, and taking features away (instead of adding), I'm finally making the switch to HR Block. Now that I've switched, I'll never go back and can just utilize HR Block every year going forward.

Well, I called Intuit and waited on hold for more than an hour (silly me), and was given a free upgrade to Premiere. Okay, that's a really round-about, not customer-oriented way to do this, and cost a LOT of customer goodwill, at least my goodwill for sure. The free upgrade should have been available online for free, or via the program if you try to use the investment capital gains section of the return. That would have saved me the frustration of having to spend over an hour of my life waiting on their pleasure. I only do taxes once a year, but it's trying enough without having the company that I pay for tax software working against me. And, this may go without saying, but if Intuit continues to exclude investment capital gains/losses from the Deluxe edition next year, I'll be taking my tax return business elsewhere.

And as Intuit must intuit by now, if it works, I and many others will stay with them out of the same inertia that kept me with Intuit all these years...in spite of the feeling that over the past few years they had evolved from something protective to something far more exploitative and predatory. The poised and slick responses of Intuit's vice president here only serve to reinforce my queasy decision to leave Turbo Tax behind. ""Gee, give me a call and let me see if I can help you find the right product."" I need a schedule C. And until I use the product I don't know if my deductions will go over the arbitrary (and preposterously low) limit they've set. I suspect they will. So I guess I'll pick my productnwithout Bob's help... Someone at Intuit is responsible for driving the predatory stance of the company and this software suite forward. Writing this review is a pain, but I'm taking the time to do it in hopes that Turbo Tax loses many more customers than myself; that individuals responsible get fired, and that the company (maybe even others) concludes that untrammeled greed and disrespect for one's consumer base is bad business."

Once upgraded to Premier I was able to continue my return. I understand Intuit will refund me $25 but it seems there is a catch. Apparently they only give you the refund if you have file 'electronically' last year (2013).

I paid $59.95 (before they dropped the price) and now I find that I will need to spend another $30 to get the features I thought I was getting in the first place. I refuse to petition Bob from TurboTax for a free upgrade as others here have done. I shouldn't need to do this. That is beneath my dignity. I am tempted to abandon TT entirely and go with something else. I've used this version for several weeks already, but only found about the loss of features by reading the comments here.

They could have at least informed the public prior to the product's release.. But oh no, that may have hurt their sales. Well I cannot say strongly enough that this is absolutely the last product I will ever buy from them. I certainly will not ""upgrade"" to to the ""premier"" version.

Well, I ended up paying over a hundred dollars to complete my taxes this year. One part time w-2 and education deduction and I was made to upgrade to deluxe and pay this crazy amount. I might as well have gone to get my taxes done elsewhere. Imagine my surprise that your offer of 25 dollars back is reserved solely for previous year deluxe users. well, we are all upset at the changes that have been made. I was sent an email that said i would be able to file my federal and state at no charge... halfway through i got the upgrade prompt. i went through and re did my taxes three times before i realized that it was not an incorrect action on my part, but a change in your program.

Instead of a refund it now states I owe the IRS over $2500. Finally found the error in the supporting section of schedule C. I suspect Intuit changed their program to the new format so Deluxe no longer supports Schedule C and Investment information. I downloaded Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe and sure enough Intuit did a real job on all of us who have used their Deluxe programs for years. I have since manually entered my supporting info on my 2013 return from my hard copy so it will not make an error when or if I download the info to another tax program.

And I find this firestorm of complaints over TT doing a bait and switch. Seems I can't use Deluxe either. I've already paid $10 more, now they want another $30.

They expect me to load this crap, pay their bait-and-switch extortion, file, then apply for a refund? Bull. If they were thinking at all, they would have simply provided the forms to Deluxe users through update. Instead, they make people jump through more hoops. Unbelievable. My purchase remains unopened, and back to the store it will go, where I'll buy H&R's Deluxe, which only costs $25. Goodbye to TT after nearly 30 years of use. Such a shame!"

I had to contact my state and get an instruction booklet for the forms, file amended returns and mail the forms in. I have had problems with Cust Serv in the past. I'm still appealing the returns with my state for 12 & 13. I won't go back. I must admit that I had a PC that deleted Intuit's Quicken while it was in the process of dying. I had a MAC I needed to switch to. The Cust Serv staff at that time (3-4 years ago) gave me the MAC version of Quicken, that isn't user friendly like the PC version, but it does what I need it to."

If you've read the other reviews on this site, you already know why I am taking the trouble to write this negative review: what used to cost me $30 would cost me $90 this year (as I have investment income, and I used to be able to make do with the ""Basic"" downloadable version). I am not romantic about corporations: Intuit doesn't owe me anything---they're in the game to make money. Even so, there seems to me to be something exploitive about a 200% price increase for a major part of Intuit's TT demographic. As Intuit is aware, people become accustomed to software and there is hassle involved in porting everything to a competitor's system; I suppose that's what they are banking on. Intuit: I resent the time I am now going to have to waste to figure out competitor's software. If you had been a little less greedy, you could probably have had my business until I stopped paying taxes."

To all of you who wrote a negative review: I agree with your sentiment and Intuit should be ashamed of themselves. If you read the very first bullet point in the product description, it says ""TurboTax has changed this year. Use the product comparison chart to find the right TurboTax software for your tax situation."" That was a red flag for me. But for the life of me I couldn't find ANYTHING on the Amazon pages that described what the changes were. ZERO. So I went directly to the TurboTax website and I spent almost 10 minutes and still couldn't find anything that described exactly what has changed. Oh sure, there are asterisks all over the place referring you to footnotes that don't describe anything about the changes. But all you can find in the footnotes is just the typical ""we'll back you up guarantee"" stuff. If you look hard enough there is a tiny tiny little ""i"" next to some of the product features but check out the photo I uploaded. If you hover over the ""i"" all it says is the same thing the general product description said: ""make sure to choose the right product.."" Again, NOTHING about what had changed. Ugh. And oh, if you scroll down a bunch and you look even harder, you MAY notice a little message that says ""* Important Offer Details and Disclosures"" and if you're sharp enough and you have really good dexterity you may notice a little down arrow next to it and you may be able to click on it but guess what? All it displays is a general list of the ""benefits"" from using TurboTax. Wow. Wow. How far TurboTax has fallen. Well, I have my H&R Block software (less expensive too) and I'm on my way. Hey Bob Meighan Mr. VP at TurboTax: I wouldn't have your people sitting by the phone hoping M in SC calls you. Seriously Bob? You couldn't leave off your ""VP"" title from your comments??

It wont even submit schedule D if I fill it out manually with no help from the software. Simply put, I felt betrayed and disrespected as a customer.

They are actually offering a free switch even to folks that already bought Turbo Tax. I've been a TT user for over 10 years, and in my opinion, the company leadership seems to be more interested in raising revenues by new pricing schemes than in offering new innovations/products. I've been using Delux, usually buying from Costco. Pretty lame not include all the Schedule D (stocks) in Delux anymore, requiring spending more. As I say, I don't mind paying for better software that does more stuff, but this seems to be a way to take advantage of the cash-cow of returning customers. HRBlock s/w can import from TT, but even if they couldn't, i'll make the switch and maybe Intuit will ""make the switch"" of the VP or CEO who came up with the analysis that said the changes in 2014 TT would get them more money. The thing is, lost market share is the real risk here for Intuit. Can't get that back Mr. senior VP."

Unless you make a public announcement that you goofed-up and will restore the same features that you had from previous years and will continue for future years, then you LOST another loyal customer. You must realize once you force us to try another product (i.e. H&R Block) we are NOT coming back.

I installed the program and downloaded the previous year tax return with no problems, just as expected. What I did not expect, was that when I went to enter my K-1 income (I am self-employed, that's the only income I have), I was greeted with an invitation to upgrade to TT Premier! Say what???!!! So I picked up the phone and called TT customer support for explanation. I was given a line about how it's a better product now than before, how it's streamlined across different platforms, etc. I told the lady that I am not happy about not being able to complete my tax return, and she immediately offered to make me happy by upgrading to Premier version at no cost. That is why I rated this product 2 stars - one for being deceptive to begin with, and one for CS effort to fix the problem. I am tempted to tell my local Costco store to place a sign above the Deluxe version that it's not the same product as in years past. I would also recommend to Intuit (and/or Amazon) to place warning on their site just below the name of the product: DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE K-1 INCOME. THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN REMOVED IN 2014 VERSION. PLEASE PURCHASE PREMIER VERSION INSTEAD. Finally, I want to state clearly for everyone reading that I do not object to companies changing prices/features/products. It's a free market, do what you want. Just be upfront about it! I will be thinking really hard this time next year whether to purchase TT Premier to complete my personal taxes, or whether to give competitor a try. I have been using TT ever since it came out, and money is really not a big problem, it's the deception that leaves bad taste in my mouth."

Instead, like thieves in the night, they hoped to sneak the change thru catching customers in the midst of filing and stuck with already purchased software and entered data. The amazing part is did they not think the aggrieved customers wouldn't remember next year even if they pay the ransom this year.

I really don't see what makes this a ""deluxe"" tax software if it doesn't do simple stock transactions. I don't care why they thought they had to do it.

A few years ago, as i highlighted in a widely read review, they did something similar by curtailing the ability of the user to do several returns with the same software purchase. Resulting criticism and buyer resistance prompted Intuit to reverse themselves. As for me, a longtime user, i am exploring other software solutions. If i am happy with the conversion capabilities of a competitor, then i plan to switch. If not, I will hold out and see if Intuit rediscovers its business ethics.

Their VP, Bob Meighan, states here that they needed to take away features to be consistent with their other (mobile and online) products. IMO, this is pathetic reasoning. If they've been planning how to position their product line for 5 years, as he states, they should have aligned their products in each ""level"" so that each delivers *at least* the same functionality as in past years. This would have boosted customer enthusiasm leading to increased sales, and made the higher-priced TurboTax products (relative to competitors) a better value proposition. Instead, they chose to downgrade products whose names are familiar to long-time customers, thus surprising and alienating many who just stayed with the same ""level"" they have used for many years. Consistent branding is important, but Intuit seems to be oblivious to this (or figured that once the product was bought, many users would buy in-product upgrades to get the functionality they took away--essentially a ""bait and switch"" tactic). BUYER BEWARE! Take another look at the competition, as I will be doing. This from a long-term user of Intuit products, who has seen their software quality decrease over the years (e.g. forum-based Turbotax help, Quicken bugs and forced upgrades)."

Getting caught cheating is not always forgiven just because you say you are sorry Turbo Tax. I've used Turbo Tax from the beginning. No more. By the way, their CEO's pay went from 13.4 million in 2013 to 16.5 million in 2014. Some of it is stock options so don't think he is offering the rebate because he is a nice guy.

I guess Amazon and/or Intuit didn't like the comment. So I am posting it again. We will see how long it says up this time. You really should read the FORBES article referenced below. I was about to buy TurboTax as I have been for the last 10-12 years. Then I saw all the negative reviews. You should read Janet Novack's article today from Forbes, (...) I recently bought Intuit Stock(INTU) thinking it would be a good investment. Within the last few weeks I got Intuit's Proxy Statement/Vote and noticed that their CEO earned over $16.5M for 2014, over $4M than the year before, most of the increase was Option Awards. That's nearly a 25% increase in one year, how many of you have gotten that kind of raise this year or ever? I voted my disapproval of Executive Compensation and intend on selling my stock Monday Morning. I would call what Intuit TurboTax Deluxe has done by removing their support for electronically file a Schedule D, for capital gains and losses; Schedule C, for profit and loss from a sole proprietorship business; Schedule E, for rental real estate, royalties and distributions from partnerships; or Schedule D, for farm income pure Corporate greed."
566,RN62JDK3E9PTB,"Intuit's Greedy Bait-and-Switch loses this Loyal Customer of 20 Years","Silently slip-streaming a shrunken version lacking the most basic of tax forms, into the same-labelled, same-priced ""DELUXE"" product, is a sneaky, cowardly act of corporate guile: as duplicitous as it is transparently poor business. A commentator at the Occam's Razor blog summed up Intuit's folly as being nowhere near as fatal as the BP oil spill, nor the Bhopal disaster - yet - perhaps it will rank high, regardless, for how it will be remembered as a gross act of blind corporate greed. So: I am a TurboTax customer who's been using TurboTax each year, faithfully, since its origins: for about 20 years now. And: recommending it to others. All that has changed in the last few weeks. Disgusted: by Intuit's outrageous disrespect toward its loyal customer base. And also: distrustful, and downright fearful, about purchasing and using the product now, since the last few days' revelations of widespread hacking of its customers' tax filing identities. Intuit claims the data hacks had nothing to do with Intuit. Yet headlines and research, including Krebs on Security and CNBC, seem less convinced, or inconclusive. Should we let Intuit off the hook regarding the exposure of customer data? Well, one bit of evidence may be the Matt Krantz piece at USAtoday (January 28, 2015) indicating Intuit is saving personal data of tax-filers who used TurboTax's efile, directly or through their CPA, including social security numbers (which Intuit evidently is asking customers to provide as a form of identification in order to claim their $25 product refund during the Deluxe version debacle). As a long-term TurboTax customer and tax efiler: I'd love to know how long Intuit is retaining my tax data. (Years?) Fortunately there are alternatives, such as downloading IRS forms directly, or using H&R Block's product which can even import prior year TurboTax data. (Ultimately I bought H&R Block's, then snail mailed my return this year.) Funny. I'm an IT analyst who's spent a career studying data privacy and security best practices... not an uninformed, superstitious rube. I suspect we simply don't yet know the full story of the TurboTax hacks. Can't back up my concerns with evidence.... but in a multitude of ways, the best I can say today, is that a company whose product absolutely MUST be all about trustworthiness: has simply and profoundly lost my confidence. _ Update: Recent headlines disclose Intuit's prolonged, aggressive, costly lobbying of Congress to suppress simpler IRS filing procedures. In other words: your major annual tax prep headache is largely engineered by Intuit's strong-arm lobbying. As NYTimes (April 2015 article) illustrates: what if paying your annual car registration required you to find your car's VIN, cross-reference multiple lookup tables, calculate the vehicle tax you owe, and process it much like you do now under income tax prep? Fortunately, instead, that tax uses a far simpler model. We could also be offering (not mandating, just offering) a similar simplification for the majority of income tax filers - if Intuit weren't playing hardball with elected officials to prevent meaningful reform. Multiple news sources suggest Intuit wants to keep your income tax prep mindbogglingly complicated: to earn a steady flow of dollars out of your pocket."
567,R3V9THIGR63Y0D,"Do Not Buy TurboTax ""Deluxe"". It is not what it was...","Donât buy this. It is not the product it was. The rumors that schedules C, D and E have been removed from TurboTax Deluxe are true. Their removal is not totally clear at first use to those of us importing last year's tax return. What do I mean?? I imported last yearâs return and the schedules were present. I did this in November. Yesterday, Jan 24th I resumed working on my tax return, but having seen complaints regarding these tax schedules for TurboTax Deluxe, I looked closer. I found various warnings on the three schedules. One was on the second page, another scheduleâs warning indicated that I may needed to upgrade to Premier, and another stated I needed to upgrade in order to use the schedule. So I called TurboTax customer service at 800-445-1875. FYI, donât hang on, use the automatic call back feature â it works. Customer service did in fact call me back within 15 minutes. After much begging, telling them how stupid this change was. I was told the box is clearly marked. And perhaps it is, but having used TurboTax Deluxe for years and TurboTax before Intuit was around, I thought I knew what I needed and to expect. Not so anymore. And since I had no box as this was an online purchase in which I downloaded TurboTax, I really did not see any warnings. FYI, donât be mad with the service agent. They are trying to help. But you have to make your case if you want a dollar free upgrade. Else, all you will obtain is a $25 cash credit at the time of your electronic filing. After you purchase the upgraded product. I worked this issue from 10AM until 3:30PM. A customer should NOT have to do this! To me this is like buying a car. I expect it to come with 4 wheels and tires. Who would have thought I needed an upgraded product as management decided to market the âDeluxeâ product this year without the needed tires... Since my purchase was made more than 60 days ago, it exceeded Intuitâs warranty refund period. And Amazon, blessed their hearts, they understood the issues. My customer service agent (Ben) was even able to obtain approvals to help me from his boss. However, with Benâs information and him on my cell, I called Intuitâs customer service for a 3rd time with our home phone. With Ben in one ear and Intuit customer service in the other I was able to relay information such that Intuit provided me a one-time, free upgrade to âhome & Businessâ as I needed a schedule C, which does not come with any of the other TurboTax products. To say Intuitâs management made a mistake is an understatement. I have used TurboTax since day one. Next year I will use H&R Blockâs tax prep software unless Intuit reverses this stupid decision. What were they smoking? Clearly they were not thinking. And I know they are not based in Washington or Colorado...As their HQ is nearby. TurboTax Deluxe is no longer my turn-to tax product and it should be rebranded âTurboTax Minusâ. I thought of other names, but kids could be reading this review... My thanks to Amazon and their staff. You continue to retain my business with your outstanding customer service. Great job Ben! I am Mike Angles in San Jose, California."
568,R3B57J22QVF657,"am I glad I read these reviews first","Wow, am I glad I read these reviews first. I had already put the product in my cart, then read the reviews. After doing my first TurboTax return in 2000, I am not going to downgrade now to a version that does not prepare and file Schedule D as it does the rest of my return. (""Prepare it by hand""...""Mail Schedule D""...really, that's the proposed solution???) It was a great run with TurboTax, but for this year I'm going to find a new solution. (Anyone have suggestions? I've read a bit about the HR Block product, that's my pick for now...but I have more homework to do) Somewhere a projection was made that the lost customers would be off-set (plus) by increased revenue from moving customers from Deluxe to Premier to retain ease/consistency in how Schedule D is prepared/filed. I'd love to see if those projections turn out to be true. I'm thinking that TurboTax must also be betting that people who leave them over this issue will not like the other products on the market...and that those customers will be back next year. Again, it would be interesting to see if those projections turn out to be true."

No where on the packaging did it say anything about 64-bit architecture required. And it took several calls to Intuit customer service to get their explanation (about the code differences). I almost switched to HR Block then but instead, used my 64-bit laptop.

I will not be purchasing TurboTax this year. TurboTax has tried this kind of pricing ""surprise"" before. Apparently back in 2008 they were attempting to charge users an additional $9.95 for each additional return whether they were printed or e-filed. After many negative reviews on Amazon, TurboTax apparently capitulated removing the extra fees for printing another return. Take a look at the Amazon reviews for TURBOTAX 2008. Seems like deja vu all over again! Honestly, how can you trust your most intimate financial details with a company that is so seemingly disingenuous or at the very least is so careless with their most valuable asset --- the customer ? Excerpts from Dec 2008 AccountingWeb Article Entitled ""TurboTax turmoil: Online reviews pan the top selling software"" are copied below illustrating the TurboTax issue in 2008. The holiday season doesn't seem to be very jolly for TurboTax 2008, at least not on Amazon.com where 171 online product reviewers have panned the perennial best selling software with one-star ratings. Users are not complaining about the functionality of TurboTax. The problem, as they see it, is with pricing changes. For the first time, TurboTax producer Intuit started charging users an additional $9.95 for each additional return whether they print or e-file. Many reviewers commenting on the product identified themselves as long-time TurboTax users who would be switching to different software because of the pricing issues. ""I have used TurboTax for many years, but not any more. The $10 fee for printing of each additional return is simply not acceptable for those of us who file a return for our children or parents as well as our own. TurboTax has not made this new fee very obvious in their advertising, so many previous users are in for a nasty surprise,"" one reviewer wrote. Another user in Santa Cruz, CA, claimed to have been a fan of TurboTax since first using it in 1992 but would be switching to another program because of ""a completely obnoxious pricing decision by Intuit."" The reader continued to comment, ""If you want to print another return you have to pay $10. I actually only do our joint return, but I often create new files to model ""what if"" scenarios, and I would be unable to print even a single form in the draft file without paying $10."" Of the 182 product reviews as of the evening of December 9, 2008, 171 of them were one-star reviews and only five were five-stars, the highest rating."

Well welcome to stage two, with making it necessary to upgrade for $30 to the Premier addition to work on schedule D, which has been standard for years. Thank goodness I looked at the review before buying the Deluxe version. Amazon is running a sale this weekend on the H&R Block tax programs which will import turbotax files and their software is less expensive than Intuit's.

But most of the years, for standard Schedule D, Deluxe would suffice. This is nothing but a significant price increase by Intuit. I really don't buy this cross platform excuse.. this is a tax software not Netflix that I want to use on 10 different devices. Visionaries even someone like Steve Jobs apologized whenever they screwed up, not telling customer that everyone is entitled to his/her opinion. Bob, I'm really surprised instead of addressing disappointment from loyal customers you are trying to justify this price gauging. Considering that Intuit doesn't care about my opinion, they probably don't care about my dime either, which definitely going somewhere going forward."
588,R1IS9PO06XNWT2,"It's Really a Shame + HR Block Software Experience Reports","Successful businesses always under-promise and over-deliver. However, judging from Intuit's unintuitive actions, they have actually OVER promised and UNDER delivered. A fantastic recipe for failure and anger from formerly loyal customers. It would have been a better idea to just up the price a bit rather than disabling features and passing it on as though it was the same product from previous years. Sure, you can say just read the label, but there was a certain amount of trust that was built up over the years between Intuit and its users...TurboTax Deluxe has always worked the same way, except for this year, that is..Forms C, D and E are no longer available and you must now upgrade to either Premier or Home and Business versions, depending on your needs. Basically, it's no longer a matter of paying more for the functionality that used to be TurboTax Deluxe, it is now a matter of confusing the issue by selling a product under the same name, same price, but with major features disabled. This is neither smart business nor good PR, as can be seen by the many negative comments written here. But it goes further than just people being mad about this ""bait and switch"" tactic, what this means is Intuit has burned its bridges and have presented themselves as untrustworthy. What other changes are coming down the road that will affect customers adversely? Let's put this simply: If Intuit staff were used to going to a favorite restaurant and were used to ordering their favorite entrees year after year, and suddenly found that the dishes they ordered all had less food, and was missing important ingredients and food components, how long do you think it would be before they left and never came back? And on top of this, the owner of the restaurant says, ""But you can get the same ingredients, food components, and quality if you only pay two times more for our new improved dishes!"" Buh bye. I am sure Intuit felt that it had a good reason for doing what it did, but it wasn't a good decision as far as I'm concerned. I have been a long time user of TurboTax, but this recent debacle has left me feeling cold and disappointed with a company that I have trusted for years. A quick fix may be in the works to get a free upgrade to a version that works, but the irreparable damage done to this company's reputation has not only angered its users, but has started a wave of bad feelings and distrust that will take years to repair. Remember, one dissatisfied customer tells 10 people, and those 10 people tell more people. Intuit, you cannot afford this kind of bad publicity. Someone dropped the ball on this, and whoever it is, needs to step back and return the full functionality of TurboTax Deluxe for next year's version, or risk losing even more customers. Intuit needs to also whip (or fire) the programmers or lead programer that cannot find a way to make cross-platform versions for TurboTax work smoothly. It's not rocket science guys. At this stage of the game, H&R Block's Premium or Deluxe version may be the way to go for disgruntled TurboTax users such as myself. I was tempted to take the free upgrade offer by calling TurboTax, but thought differently about taking this course of action because of the dirty tactics by Intuit. I may get the freebie this year, but what about next year when I have to pay full price or get more features deleted? I will drop TurboTax this year and will be switching to HR Block Deluxe, which covers all the schedules formerly in TurboTax Deluxe, to see if it works; I have already ordered it. It's worth the risk in order to move away from TurboTax and Intuit's customer angering policies. They have to make a profit, and this is understandable. What isn't understandable is the sneaky and underhanded way they did this. They have lost my trust and it will be hard for them to win it back, if ever again, as I'm sure other former TurboTax users will agree. I will provide an update on HR Block Deluxe here after I receive it. Look for the in-depth review on HR Block Deluxe in the coming weeks. UPDATE ON HR BLOCK DELUXE: 1/12/2014 ----------------------------------------- I just installed HR BLOCK DELUXE in lieu of my usual TurboTax Deluxe product. HR BLOCK states that this version is compatible for Windows all the way to XP with SP3. After installation, which was very easy, I was presented with the option to import last year's TurboTax income tax data. It was able to search and find this file automatically, but after I hit the ""import"" button, I received an error message that stated: ""HRBLOCK has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience."" Apparently, after doing a search on the Internet, this seems to be a bug in the software when running on XP machines. HR BLOCK has not given an official fix date for this, nor an official statement, although some users said they were promised a fix from the 1/9/2014 update release. However, this did not solve the problem. The next update is scheduled for 1/22/2-14 from HR BLOCK, but no word as to whether or not this will fix the import bug. As I am typing this update, I have been online waiting for a chat representative to explain and offer some sort of fix date for this bug. I am number 10 on the waiting list, and it has been almost an hour and I am still waiting. (I am doing other computer related work while waiting). I also tried calling HR BLOCK's customer service number and was put on hold for over 15 minutes, when I decided to hang up. So far, this experience with HR BLOCK has not been stellar. I do NOT want to return to TurboTax Deluxe, but if HR BLOCK drops the ball on this, it will have lost my confidence, as well as many other former TurboTax users regarding the inability to import TurboTax data as promised. If you are running Windows XP, you may want to hold off buying HR BLOCK DELUXE until a fix for the import function is available, and hopefully, this will be soon. UPDATE 1/12/2014 CHAT Session with HR BLOCK REP ---------------------------------------------------- Here's a transcription of the chat session I just had after waiting one hour and 20 minutes to chat with an HR Block rep. The results aren't very inspiring for customer support there. The rep's name has been replaced to protect the guilty, other info has been changed to protect the innocent. The dialogue is funny and tragic. Read the part about ""TT."" ----------------------- HR REP.: Hello ----, welcome to H&R Block Tax Product Support! Please allow me a few moments to review the information you have submitted to us. ME: Hi, I hope you can help me. I cannot import my 2013 TT data into 2014 HR Block Deluxe as advertised by the product description. I get an error message that states the program has run into a problem and must shut down. I have just switched from TT Deluxe to HR Block's version this year due to the Intuit downgrade fiasco eliminating Schedules C,D, E and other forms. But unfortunately, this hasn't been a very good start with the HR Block product. Is there a fix for this from HR Block, and how long will it be till the update fix is available, if at all? If it takes too much time or the fix isn't available, I will have to go back to TurboTax for full functionality, something that I really would hate to do. ME: ...I a running Windows XP Service Pack 3 HR REP.: I'm sorry but when you say TT, can you explain what you are referring to? ME: TurboTax Deluxe HR REP.: Thank you, let me just verify some information from you. Can I please get your e-mail address, phone number, and zip code please? ME: Sure, my email address is: -----------------------ME: Home phone is: --------------- HR REP.: Where did you purchase the software? ME: Amazon.com HR REP.: Do you need help with the steps to download it? ME: no. I have already installed it. As I mentioned, it does not import last year's Turbotax info as stated in the description for HR BLOCK Deluxe. I would like to know when a fix for this bug will be available. HR REP.: I'm sorry this will be technical support, and this is product support. I am not sure when the bug is available. I would either return the CD back to Amazon or get in touch with Tech Support. ME: How do I do this? ME: And since this is product support, can you look up an answer for me? HR REP.: I would call the 1-800 number tomorrow morning, the number is on the H&R Block website. ME: Wow. This isn't looking too good for us former Turbo Tax users. Thanks anyway for your time. I waited over an hour for this, lol. HR REP.: Is there anything else I can assist you with today? ME: No. That's it. Have a good evening. Take care. HR REP.: I would like to let you know that you may receive a short Customer Satisfaction Survey by e-mail in the next day or two. If you could take a moment to provide me with some feedback on my performance today, I would really appreciate it. HR REP.: Thank you for contacting H&R Block Tax Product Support, ------. We look forward to supporting you in the future! ME: Not too sure about that, though. Thanks anyway. Thank you for using H&R Block Technical Support. Your satisfaction is important to us. You'll soon receive a short survey via e-mail. Please share your thoughts about your service experience. Your chat has now ended. Please close this window. Your session has ended. You may now close this window. UPDATE 3/23/2015: ------------------------------------- In the early part of February, HR Block released a fix for the Windows XP bug that wouldn't allow the importing of last year's Turbo Tax Deluxe tax data. The fix worked perfectly and I was able to complete my taxes with HR Block Deluxe. The session went smoothly, the e-filing of both my federal and state tax forms went without a hitch. As of now, I am an HR Block convert and have dropped Turbo Tax Deluxe as my go-to tax preparation software. Intuit's incessant agenda of taking advantage of its customers, its highly confusing product line, and the constant juggling of its prices for its products has left me with a large confidence hole in ever doing business again with Intuit and its Turbo Tax products."
589,R3Q277Z1TOZTQJ,"What a sad story for Turbo Tax","What is going on with Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014?? I have been using Turbo tax since early 2000. I really liked the product. I used to file the basic version when I was single. Since I got married about 8 years ago, I've been using the Deluxe version. Last year for the first time I used Schedule C for my spouse's business income. It came in handy though I never used the feature before. Due to the business expansion we hired a CPA to do our business tax this year. I don't foresee doing any schedules this year. I do not need to have this feature to do my tax this year so I was just going to purchase the Deluxe edition for our 2014 joint personal income tax. As of today I see 171 one star review out of 242. I could not believe my eyes and I started reading the reviews. They were terrible. I think Intuit is making a big mistake. I do use other Intuit products/apps like Checks (Now Mint Bills), Mint, and ItsDeductibles. I still like them. I do not understand why Intuit made this move. Is this how they want to do their business? I could have been care less about those who need their schedules to file their taxes. I could have said it's not my problem. But as a customer it is important for me how a company conducts their business and treats their customers. I was not happy when I read all these reviews and what Intuit was doing. It bothered me greatly. According to lar (Dallas, Tx) & Larry Bellinger (Albany, NY USA) H&R Blocks seems a better choice both in pricing and features over Turbo Tax. I have been doing some pro-bono work at my job for those who are working in retail to file their taxes each year. I always use H&R Block software to file their Fed/State e-file at behive website. It's free if you are earning $58,000 or less, and if you have a straightforward tax filing needs. I am not sure if this is available in other states. I live in NY. I wished I was qualified. To those who do not need to file schedules just like me, it might also make sense to consider H&R Block. It is so sad because I had been using Turbo Tax for almost 15 years. Now I need to look for another product. Is it the greed why Intuit is doing this? This seems be the worst rating Turbo Tax ever had. If I am noticing I am sure others are also noticing about their bad decision."
590,R37DQYMF65ILZD,"Too bad they tried to pull a fast one on their ...","Intuit has lost their way. Too bad they tried to pull a fast one on their customer base by reducing functionality. Taking advantage of the HR Block offer for free deluxe software. Goodbye Turbo Tax."
591,R233N4HA14I0N2,"Finally reversed, but this disaster will be studied at business school for years","A few minutes ago, a blog post from the Wall Street Journal announced: ""Amid a continuing uproar, the maker of TurboTax tax-preparation software said Thursday it would reverse changes in its products that forced some customers to pay more to prepare 2014 tax returns. Intuit plans to reverse the changes next year, and also said it would shield some customers from or compensate them for additional costs incurred this year."" As a very long time user of Turbotax, it's about time. Will this permanently impair the product? Hard to tell. I can guarantee this, though: the series of disastrous decisions that led up to the reversal will likely be studied in B-School for decades to come, along with Intuit's attempts to regain their customer base. We'll see, but their track record isn't exactly promising."
592,R3T31NLXY6I9XE,"What a boneheaded move.","No apology for giving me less, just an apology for not communicating the change. I hate when a company does this to loyal, long-time customers. Unfortunately, they already have my money for this year. I'd consider coming back if the apology included a statement that moving forward, they will include the old feature set as part of the Deluxe product. Until then, good bye TurboTax, hello H&R Block. I hope the CEO feels shareholder (and Board) pressure and that the product manager got fired because this was a move to increase revenue without fully assessing the impact to customer experience and retention. The correct way to handle this is to say, ""Wow, we really screwed the pooch. It happens and must have been caused by bad mushrooms. Here's the link to download the (former) full feature set for Deluxe. Rest assured that we hear you and will rectify the situation moving forward. Please accept our heartfelt apology."" That, I could understand and respect. Anything else is an attempt to justify greed."
593,R2SLGOEBE1HBZ5,"How to stick your foot up your backside, corporate style!!","I too will most likely be joining the ranks of FORMER long term TT users. I wish I'd seen these reviews sooner than today. I was in Costco a few days ago and decided to grab the TT software while I was there as it was convenient to do so. I know I need more than the basic version, and *thought* I remembered purchasing the 'Deluxe' version in the past, but always glance at the bullet points to make sure. Turns out I must have been mistaken, because Deluxe doesn't do what I need. I guess it was the Premier that I got before. Ouch, the price has gone up. Oh well, I need it. Bought it. Now I come on here after seeing a comment on a board I read, and realize that TT has made some ""cross platform improvements"" to eliminate ""inconsistencies"", and done so by dumbing down the version I actually *used* to buy by removing functionality from it. Here on Amazon I discover from these comments what's ACTUALLY happened, and the damage control attempts being made by Mr. Mieghan and his associates, which appear to me mainly to be making things worse, with many of them seeming to have at least a slight tone of condescension in them - things like (paraphrased here) ""We did this to make things consistent across different platforms"" ""The changes are noted on the packaging"" ""We'd like to keep/regain you as a loyal customer"" (when taken to task by decade + long users who're leaving for other software) and one of my favorites, when asked why the name wasn't changed ""Should we change the name when we add features to it too?"" My response to the last is that no, you don't need to change the name when you add features (though you can if you'd like, to call attention to the improvements), because adding features actually IMPROVES the product. ADDING features means that the product is AT LEAST as good as it was last year, and that if it worked for me LAST YEAR it will still work for me THIS YEAR. What you've done in your ""improvement"" is to REMOVE features that I used last year, which means that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT the same product that it was. It is not AT LEAST as capable as it was last year, and it WILL NOT do what I used it for last year. Here's a news flash, on the off chance that the other thousand plus scathing one star reviews haven't gotten through to you all - this is not an improvement! Mr. Meighan, in the future if Intuit wants to make cross platform improvements may I suggest that you look at the software's capabilities on all the platforms, and if features are lacking on one or more of those platforms that are present on others, then the way to actually IMPROVE things would be to ADD the missing features to those platforms that lack them, rather than what you've done in this case which is to REMOVE the features from something that's had them for years, and then tell people ""Oh, sorry, we made this better for most people (you must be in that 2-4% who we figure can go jump in a lake). If you want to do what you did last year with this product that has the exact same name as last year (though see - it's different - the word 'Deluxe' on the packaging is smaller this year - you should have noticed that and realized that because deluxe is in smaller print it means it's a little LESS 'deluxe' this year!!), you need to buy the next one up in the line that's $30 more than the one you used last year. We made that old one 'consistent' don'tcha know? We're very sorry that this affects you - it only affects a few people. I'm terribly sorry that you're righteously pissed about it, but if you waste some of your time and call us and luck out with the right customer service rep, we *might* cut you some kind of break for what you need. If you're going to do what you've done in this case, then CHANGE THE NAME, because REMOVING capabilities means it's NOT THE SAME AS LAST YEAR'S WAS!! That way at least people will know it's different, and realize that it may not do what it did before, that they need/expect it to be able to do. Whoever came up with this brilliant idea should be sacked, because it appears that they've caused some pretty major harm to the Turbo Tax 'brand'. Based on what I've seen here, despite the fact that I bought the higher level product that WILL do what I need I plan to return the software (fortunately have not opened it yet) for a refund and try the H & R Block product, apparently for less $$ than what the 'Deluxe' version of your software, which I've always used in the past but cannot this year thanks to your 'improvements'. As for next year, who knows. If H&R Block works as well, why change back?"
594,R337TKSTESH4MM,"Sad,Sad day!","All I can say is thank you for those early purchaser's this year. I just researched my software box and found TT disk (floppies) going back to 1992.

Well I guess my email list will have to suffer one more hit so that I can notify everyone of this strange new ""marketing"" by Intuit. I guess they will find out if this gamble payed off soon enough.

I get to my wife's low-volume Schedule C work and now I'm being forced to spend another $10 for Home & Business! All functions that I've done in Deluxe for seems like decades. I know that if I jumped off into a profanity-laden tirade that my review would get deleted, so I'll just say this, Intuit: it's not me, it's you. You've lost a long, long, long-time customer.

I didn't realize that it was a MUST to upgrade to Premier this year. I thought Deluxe would still handle my Schedules D and E and ignored the advertisement saying Premier was best for me. (because they have always said Premier was best for me) Well, not true anymore, I'm forced to upgrade to Premier, for the same software I've used in the past. I'm over it... TURBOs competitors have made it much easier for me to switch to their tax software. Shady, under-handed tactics on Intuits part...looks like you've lost a lot customers over this."

At the time Parsons Technology had put out a product called Personal Tax Edge for $19.95, so I switched. Within 2 years Intuit purchased Parsons Technology and offered TurboTax again for a lower price, so I stayed with TurboTax. They have steadily increased the price of both Quicken and TurboTax. I was a repeat customer who allowed them to pre-order the software, charge my card and later email me the download link. Last year I noticed that Amazon customers could purchase the same software for $20 less than a repeat loyal customer. I called and complained and was told that Amazon could charge whatever they wanted but Intuit was bound to the price I paid. So I discontinued the ""automatic renewal"" subscription with Intuit and boy am I glad I did! I would have been totally whacked if I had got the renewal and then discovered that it would not file my schedule C. So I researched TaxACT and discovered that this company is the same people that did the Personal Tax Edge for Parsons Technology before Intuit purchased the company and canned them. I can get the TaxACT software download for state and federal PLUS a backup CD-rom, plus a state e-file (for which TTax charged an additional $19.95) for under $37!! So, TTax for $89.95 (on Amazon) or TaxACT for $36.95......no brainer...I switched...particularly after I found out that TaxACT will grab all the pertinent info from the pdf. file saved from last year's TurboTax and quick-fill the new tax form."

(The trust distributed income again gets taxed after flowing onto the beneficiary's Form 1040). I don't believe Intuit's explanation on their substantial price increase, if so they would have kept the comparable products (what's needed to do the same as what was included in 2013's Deluxe, for example)at the same price plus any incremental inflation. They would have to explain the substantial $ increase when wage growth is stagnant and inflation is low. Maybe it's a good time for buying some H&R Block shares. I started using the H & R product that includes both discs and find it good so far (for approx. 1/4 price).

I called the Turbo Tax helpline and surprisingly got through to a real person with minimal wait. The rep was pleasant and provided me with a ""free upgrade"" to the Premier version, which basically means they upgraded me to the same version I bought over the past 15 years. They did say in the future the ability to generate a schedule D will require that I purchase the Premier version for $75 to $85 instead of the normal $40 to $50 cost that has been fairly constant over the years. If the good folks at TurboTax don't add this basic functionality back to their Deluxe version of the software next year, I will be purchasing the much less expensive H&R Block software in the future.

So if I want, I can accomplish this year, what I did last year, at the same cost as Deluxe. But this year only -- next year, I'll have to buy TurboTax Home and Business for much more. Or, will I? I think I'll try alternative software like H&R Block. Which frankly is sounding more interesting to me right now. I see that H&R Block will give you their software for free if you buy TT Deluxe and get fed up with what Intuit has done. Personally I think this is a Big Mistake that Intuit is making, companies have gone out of business doing this. Maybe Intuit will realize this before it's too late and other tax software takes away the lead they have held. (This comment is mostly my opinion but it's based on confirmed information; I urge you to do your research and make your own decision.)"

This has major hidden flaws (they are spelled out in the really small print at the bottom of the add.","I have used Turbo Tax since 1990 according to my files and I have never looked anywhere else. It was a good reliable product. I have all the background I need to do the filings, so all I needed Turbo Tax to do is provide me the forms and a way to file. Because of this, Deluxe has worked perfectly fine for me in the past. I've always looked at the higher end versions as providing the information behind what went on a form. Also the interviews and advice videos to get users to the correct form or to think about what else. Now for ""consistency"" they have crippled Deluxe. Not sure how having different versions handling the same piece of ""paper"" differently adds to consistency. Guess H&R will get another look; go to TaxWise, or another vendor. All of them handle the ""paper"" the same way and their additional costs are related to them giving you additional information or advice on what goes where. I'm happy to pay when they add value I need. Not willing to pay when their work consists of crippling their product and providing advice I don't need. They had to build a version that does everything and then do more work to dumb it down. Having a form in the software and then not being able to file it I think borders on what I would call fraud, in my non-legal opinion, or at best the old bait and switch. They are betting on users buying Deluxe out of habit and then paying for the upgrade at the last minute because all the data is entered and they found out on April 14, they can't file the necessary forms."
639,R34X1KUTE4JWVQ,"Never again","I was about to purchase this, figuring it was a no-brainer like every year, then noticed all the negative reviews. I had thought Intuit had learned their lesson after the infamous ""you can't print your return unless you pay us more"" scheme of a few years ago. I need to file schedules C, D, E, and K-1, and I find Intuit's baffling double-speak responses to criticism appalling. H&R Block has gotta be rolling on the floor laughing."
640,R185KCCQOUVEAL,"There Are Affordable Alternatives Out There","Most people here already know the mess Intuit made by taking away previously included features. I have been using TurboTax for years. I got a couple of emails from Intuit about this. The latest one says as a previous user I can still use the Deluxe with schedule C, D, E and F at no additional cost. The email provides link for me to ""Lean more."" But the link merely opens a product page on which it clearly shows that to get Schedule C, D, E and F I'll still need the Premiere version. There is no mentioning how I can get those forms the Deluxe version. What a joke. Newegg.com is having a 50% discount on H&R Block product and I took advantage of that. With the discount I get the premiere version with those forms and free state e-filing for only $32.47. Granted I have not used it but H&R Block is a reputable brand and I expect I'll be fine. H&R Block claims that it import previous Intuit tax file, too so that's a big plus. The discount ends soon so if you are in the same situation as I am you might want to take a look. Intuit made the mistake of making me look elsewhere, and I may never go back."

My issue this year is Schedule E, for my share of a family farm, though I'll often use Schedule D for mutual fund sales. It seems silly that they chose to cripple the desktop product to make it compatible w/ the online product, rather than enhancing the online product. Selling investments will probably become a lot more common in future years. I'm not so disgusted w/ Intuit because they made this change but, rather, because they failed to effectively communicate the change prior to tax season. I still don't find a description of this change on the TurboTax website. I had to find out about it from a TV news story. I'm also unable to return this software to Amazon, presumably because we downloaded it over a month ago, so I'm stuck. I'll be looking at other alternatives, specifically the H&R Block product.

I went to pay... but TurboTax could not process a credit card. After trying 10 times I gave up. I called their customer Help. I got an message saying the are busy, and left my info to get an Auto call back for Help so they could process a good credit card. I now have little faith in the accuracy of thier tax software if they can't even handle processing a credit card. I waited 2 hours. Finally, their automated system called me and said it was connecting me to a customer service rep... then all I got was light static and a slight humming noise. TurboTax automated system has my phone line in CONSTANT USE!. I cannot get it to hang up. I cannot make a call, I cannot even dial 911 if there was an emergency. I cannot get in touch with anyone at Turbotax to help. Now I'm trying to call my phone company on someone else phone to get them to force a disconnect with the Turbotax system. After years of using Turbotax, This is a nightmare!!!!!!!!! If there is TurboTax person that reads this... CONTACT ME... turn my phone line free.!!! For all others who are thinking of using TurboTax, even if you used them for years... BEWARE!!! THEY ARE NOT THE TURBOTAX WE KNEW.!! - Update: My phone company did manage to disconnect the in use line that TurboTax we holding. TurboxTax never called me back, even after another help request. They couldn't process a good credit card to pay for the extra $19.99 efile for State, but thier system did ask me to pay another $29.95 to deduct the $19.99 from my refund. NO THANKS!

I called support (800-624-9066) and explained my tax situation in great detail. I specifically mentioned 1099-B and Schedule D. I was told ""Deluxe"" would do the job. I ordered it and installed it (including all the updates). When it came time to enter my 1099-B information it said ""you need Premier - Insert another $30"". I called support back and waited over 30 min on hold. Intuit has promised me a free Premier and free TurboTax next year. But the phone lines are only going to get more backed up as people figure out what's going on. So I certainly can not recommend Deluxe unless you have a return that is basically an ""EZ"". It did seem happy to process my 1099-DIV so if that's the extent of what you need you may be ok. I did not get to the deductions section so I don't know if it will let you itemize or not.

Seems both Amazon and Intuit are complicit in this decision to allow Turbo Tax Deluxe to go forward for sale and not inform the previous users in a proactive manner like sending them a heads up email way in advance of purchasing for the 2014 tax season.

A week went by and there was no notice that the product had shipped, I called again today to ask where the upgrade was. The rep promised to send it, but 6 hours later, I have no notification that the order was even entered. I prefer the CD as it is easier to access past years returns if you have the CD. Still, all of this seems like way too much work for a product whose only purpose is to simplify my life. I read today that Intuit has apologized and offered a rebate for those affected by the change, but really do not see why they cannot simply download an update containing support for the forms used by most people who need software beyond the basic. Given the number of people that are commenting on the issue here, the position taken by Intuit that the change will affect only a few people is clearly wrong. I will not use TurboTax next year if this awful decision is not reversed, and Intuit will have lost one of its most loyal customers"

I need to file a simple schedule E every year and most years also have to file schedule D and the Deluxe version handled them both very nicely. So when I found out that the 2014 version handles neither one (without upgrading to Premier), I decided it was time to look elsewhere. It's really a pity that Intuit has decided to ""dumb down"" the Deluxe version, because I suspect it is their best selling version. As soon as customers find out that they have been duped (again), they are going to speak out very loudly with their wallets. I'm going to wait until January to see if Intuit comes to it's senses, but if they don't, then I'm going to save 10 bucks instead of spending an extra 40 and go with H & R Block."

It imported the TurboTax data from last year very easy, does all the things that last years TurboTax did, and is much easier to use if you need to override a number or change a number on the completed tax form. Very easy to use. Goodbye TurboTax."

Last week I received a letter from Intuit highlighting the big need for the change and offering to reimburse $25 if I subsequently purchased Premier. Although they recognize the self-mutilation they have caused their company the executives gamely try to cover the issue with a refund. Sorry folks - I had a different idea. Deluxe was returned and I purchased a different tax preparation product. I don't think your $25 will recover very many of the previously loyal customers that you lost with this trick. Probably time to give the boss a big bonus for his wise leadership."
688,R2ZU03SE5SYGWK,"Like everyone else here","Like everyone else here, I read about the changes that were made and decided to switch to H & R Block software. I had used Turbotax for two years since I switch from paying an accountant and loved it, but with the added cost of the software and the VP response I've decided to go with H & R Block and love it."
689,R113MCG6W9T1JO,"Too bad they forgot their customers","Dumped TurboTax this year due the reduced features of Deluxe Version and the price. Been using it forever.

There are other acceptable choices with more features and lower price."
690,R2HUUTEJW1HKQ5,"Intuit omits basic tax forms in Deluxe","This is criminal. Yeah they are giving a rebate to upgrade to Premier. But Deluxe should have the most basic forms needed, like Schedule D. Not the complication of ESOPs, options, etc., but basic capital gains. Rebate this year, but screwed next year, you can bet on it."

692,R24IU88BPC86F5,"Switch to other tax prepare software","I used Turbotax deluxe version for over 10 years, purchased this year deluxe edition without any thinking. When I start use it, I found this year I can't do schedule D. I switched to H&R BLOCK 2014 Deluxe, so far I like it. Very easy to import last year's Turbo tax file, and also it is easy to use."
693,R1NUZABVA7J7WC,"This is WRONG!","I have been using Turbo tax for myself, my mother and my brother since 1997. During all this time, I could reliably depend on Turbo tax Deluxe to painlessly guide us through the complex tax process, especially to account for my mutual fund transactions. To hear that the Deluxe version is no longer capable of taking care of my investments data, and that I have to purchase the much more expensive premiere version to do so, is plain WRONG. I'm glad I had a chance to read the reviews on this site before I purchase Turbo tax this year. Regretfully, I must part with Turbo tax, and I will heed the advice to look into H&R Block's deluxe version for my tax needs from this year onward. PS I will also relate this sad news to my friends who have also been using Turbo Tax for the same time period."
694,R2VSJ66WTKA7XT,"Another customer lost","Intuit, you just lost another long-time customer. Removing features to make it consistent with your crippled online version is not the way to repay loyal customers. I'm guessing you heard about customers complaining about the missing features in online Deluxe which you recommend upgrading to online Premier. Too many people realizing they can just buy the desktop version to get the features they need? Offering me a ""one time"" upgrade to Premier won't keep me either. Plus, I have to install the software to get the free upgrade via download? That complicates the fact that I might want to return the product, and doesn't fix the problem for next year. I will be returning the product and using HR Block's software from now on. I thought Intuit would have learned its lessons from the big DRM issue in 2003, but I guess they are still trying to wring every dollar they can from their loyal customer base."

I was on their AUTO BUY and had the software sent to my house every year automatically. I cancelled it this year because of the PRICE jump and what they did to the to the software making you have to go to the more expensive product for certain features. I was shocked to see the almost 300 1 star reviews, and a VP of Turbo Tax replying to the comments. Guys, remember ""NETFLIX""?? I bought H&R Block tax software this year mostly due to price. Again I used your software for years and years and loved it but if someone is going to give me the same service for almost half less with all the features & SUPPORT I need and not have to go to the next level for additional features.... BAD MOVE!!"
696,R17EJMWZAP8TZ4,Disgusted,"I've been using Quicken since the early 90s and TurboTax for several years. The change to remove electronic filing for schedules C, D E and F is absolutely ridiculous! Why shouldn't I be able to manually fill out the forms then e-file them without paying an extra $30? I did call Intuit and they did upgrade me for free to the Premier version, but that was after spending at least 30 minutes on hold. Intuit better get it right next year or I will be switching to H&R Block Deluxe. I will also be looking for a Quicken replacement (after using it for more than 20 years). Bob, why are you having people call customer support? Why have them get even more angry for being on hold for 30 minutes? You have their email addresses. Why not just send them an email with instructions for getting the free Premier upgrade? Or are you not sincere in your response?"

Then I read the reviews, and realized why. I need to file a Schedule D as I buy and sell a few stocks, and TT Deluxe has always handled this in the past. Not anymore, it seems--Intuit now wants me to purchase the Premier version at a significantly higher price to accomplish this. This is America. Intuit is as free to decontent their products as I am to not purchase them. And I'm voting with my wallet. Goodbye, Intuit! Hello, H&R Block!"

Not only have they constantly sold me a product that costs more than I can get it here on Amazon or at one of the membership box stores, but this year they changed Deluxe and dropped Sched D without informing me that they had made a significant change. I just purchased a second copy for my father-in-law two weeks ago. Both of us have been long time TT Deluxe users. Evidently, no more. From reading the VP's comments here, it is clearly spin to try to damage control. We changed it so mobile users were better off. Really? It wasn't so you could charge more? I cannot believe all that many folks file with mobile phones or tablets on something as critical as taxes unless it is a 1040EZ."

Having sold stock in 2014, I was very glad for all the reviews alerting me to this change in Deluxe. Based upon other's reviews, I purchased H&R Block for a little over $34 after tax. While I haven't filled it out yet as don't have my W-2, it installed easily and imported last year's info from TurboTax. An aside - while a satisfied customer of TurboTax for years, I am happy to leave them given this latest move and my experience a couple years ago when I did the online version. The price wasn't shown (should have been a red flag) but I assumed it wouldn't be more than what it cost to buy the disc at Sam's Club or Staples. I was wrong! It was more, but at that point I had everything entered and didn't want to start from scratch. Left bad taste regarding Intuit's business practices."
702,RMHSTTSKFVKBN,UNCONSCIONABLE!,"UNCONSCIONABLE! : not guided or controlled by conscience : unscrupulous. That is the perfect description of Intuit. I have used Turbo Tax software for probably over 20 years going back to the DOS versions but not this year. I am done with them and am switching to H&R Block software. To intentionally disable critical forms that have been an integral part of TurboTax Deluxe for years and then try to gouge users for double the cost to get access to the forms IS UNCONSCIONABLE! The genius at Intuit that dreamed up this PR disaster should be shown the door faster than you can eFile! Any class action lawyers reading these reviews should scrutinize the Turbo Tax packaging and the methods Intuit has employed with this bait and switch attempt to see if their is a basis for a lawsuit."
703,RTYOVGUGXZYAU,"What has happened to Turbo Tax?","Just got online and went to Amazon to purchase ""Turbo Tax Delux"" which we have been using for our family's tax filing for about the last 14 or 15 years. I briefly glanced at the review rating and then did a double take when I noticed that out of 1237 reviews 87 were five star, 17 were four star, 7 were three star, 30 were 2 star and then a staggering 1,096 reviews were ONE star. I could not believe it. I've used this product for so long and now it was being advertised as having basically a one star rating?? So I read the reviews and just could not understand what has become of what I have depended on for so very long. This year my wife and I retired. We worked up until April 2014 and then started receiving Social Security and distributions from our retirement accounts. With all the changes that Intuit has made to this product, including requiring the user to purchase needed forms which have always been included in the past, how may I trust the performance of this products original intention which was to: *interview the user *determine any scenario that the user could present *using that scenario, calculate if the user owed the Federal and State governments money or be entitled to a refund *fill out the proper forms accordingly From the many comments it appears that ""Turbo Tax Delux"" is a shattered product and I do not know if it will interview my situation properly, provide the necessary forms automatically and fill out those forms automatically as well? I do not feel that if I purchase Turbo Tax, what I submit to the Federal and State governments will be dependable, reliable and safe. What has happened to Turbo Tax? Even if the product needed to be changed to: accommodate changes in technology, accommodate changes in tax law, or for whatever reason that Turbo Tax offers, that dependable interview with the user to determine all the variables needed to formulate their individual tax return and to provide assurance that one's return was being prepared safely and correctly, is now lost. I don't know anything about Turbo Tax's corporate culture but being a new retiree I really must wonder who is running the ship over there? Have things shaken up? Is the employee base mostly younger inexperienced workers? Where is management? Are they paying ""close"" attention to their subordinates? How many staff meetings did the different departments have and how many successful resolutions were determined on how to deal with such a drastic change in their product? What thought was put into how their huge reliable customer base would react? Was this really the best approach that the CEO, Vice Presidents, General Managers, Managers, Supervisors and staff could come up with to provide a dependable product for the 2014 tax return? I think that the main concern for this great company now will be ""damage control"". According to the reviews on this merchants site alone, 88.6% (1096 1 star reviews) of the Turbo Tax customers coming to Amazon has been lost. I really do not know what I am going to do this year for preparing taxes. I'll look at H&R, or I may just return to the olden days when I would have to go to a professional tax preparer and pay more than the $49.99 price that Turbo Tax is asking.......but.....I do hope that Turbo Tax works harder on next years products."
704,R130SN6KPDIV7K,"Major Change to the Deluxe Version","Well, like the others have said, Intuit removed key features to file anything but the most basic return....thanks Intuit!!

Like others, I have been a long time TT user and expected to do the same this year. I was fortunate to read the many reviews on Amazon and ultimately bought H&R Block Deluxe instead. Fox news even did a piece on Intuit's sneaky move (http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3978602133001/turbotax-users-upset-over-sneaky-price-hike/?intcmp=us_topics#sp=show-clips) and suggested an 800 number to complain and possibly get a free upgrade this year (800-445-1875).

The steady price increases along with no increased value that I could see, convinced me to look for alternatives. With the Deluxe at $49 (Which is less than the deluxe of prior years) the premiere at $75, and the business edition at $135, I decided to switch to a slayer of taxes instead at less than 1/3 of the cost of Intuit's software. There are other less expensive and valid choices as well, no reason to stick with this product if you're not happy with the price."

So I definitely don't want to pay even more for Premier for the same functionality I got with Deluxe previously. Looks like a great year to try out one of the other products like H&R Block. Goodbye TurboTax. It's funny, I dropped Quicken several years ago for similar reason... they started forcing upgrades by disabling online data downloads after 3 years. Apparently, Intuit does not care about retaining customers, which seems like an unusual business model. Oh well, change is good."
713,RHGMZ04ILHMM9,"Poor decision by Intuit","I've been a TurboTax Deluxe user for the past 15 years. Intuit's decision to remove most functionality for Schedule ""D"" in the Deluxe version of the product is accompanied by the disingenuous corporate speak which has become all too common in today's consumer marketplace. The rational for the change is to provide ""consistent product functionality across [platforms]"". Well, my platform seems to be behaving in a very inconsistent manner with this change. Why not just support schedule D in all versions of Deluxe? If consistency is the goal, implement changes in a way that is the least disruptive for customers. I expect that next Intuit will be saying they made the change for my ""convenience"". Kind of like when Intuit decided to require product activation for TurboTax in 2003."
714,R3MQZ35J3N6DN4,"Like the other thousands of long time","Like the other thousands of long time, loyal users I am extremely upset over the 50% increase in cost to get three critical schedules that have been a standard part of the Deluxe package for over so many years AND the sneaky approach and illogical (weasel worded) explanation utilized by Intuit senior management with long time customers. I am so angry that I have made the switch to H&R Block and Paid the full on line price, declining to take the significant H&R Block discount offered to customers who had already bought TurboTax 2014. You have to question the key decision makers at Intuit who agreed to this roll out approach and the intellectually insulting explanation that was emailed to TurboTax customers."

This is simply a money grab but this time I believe you are about to take a big HIT! I truly hope you take the largest profit decrease in your company's history. I feel that you just lost your most loyal consumers and I'm sure they will share their frustration with all of their friends and relatives. You made a BIG MISTAKE.

Maybe we need to start contacting our elected representatives to make sure they understand that they should encourage a true low cost alternatives and ""real"" electronic filing. If I have to do this, then why use TT in the first place. Yuk. Also, I _think_ this ""consistency"" argument is a bit misleading as well. Deluxe version used to allow Sch. D in past years. So what did TT do - last year they ""removed"" it from the online version but left it in the CD/Download version to make it ""inconsistent"". Wait - now we need to make it consistent this year and so what do they do - remove it in the offline version as well.

I have also used Quicken for more years than TT. I will dump this product at my earliest opportunity also. Today I purchased the H&R Block tax software. Too bad Intuit, you lost another previously loyal customer. The entire marketing dept. should be sacked and the CEO should admit they screwed up horribly, apologize profusely and add back the functionality that was taken away.

I bought my usual Deluxe software and was disgusted to find out that Deluxe functions and features had been stripped away and moved into the Premier version. The software price had been steadily increasing and I, along with millions others, had been willing to go along with it because I could count on the year-to-year consistency of the user interface, the functions and features. If I had to figure out what's in and what's out from year to year, I might as well try different software or methods. You noted that ""only 20% of its TurboTax E-filers last year used the boxed or downloaded software and that only a small share of those filed a D,C, E, or F. "". I hope you didn't pay a lot of money to data scientists, or the executives who made this decision, who gave you a profile of your customers and how they use your product, and how you can maximize your income... What is your CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST and your CUSTOMER RETENTION COST? Let's see how that 20%, ONLY 20%, will hurt your bottom-line. Loyalty can be quite expensive. UPDATE: So after seeing the backlash from their loyal customers, and only after more than 2 months of mounting negative reviews on Amazon, Intuit makes a public apology and wants to make it right by offering a $25 rebate(subject to certain conditions) to ease the transition to their new pricing. Still leaves a bad taste in the mouth because they maintain the move to strip the Deluxe of its old functionalities was to improve customer service when we all know it's to improve their bottom-line. Still no respect for their customers' intelligence. So even though I got a free upgrade, I'll get the HR Block software going to ease MY transition."

It is unconscionable what Intuit has done with the software and the ""Bait and Switch"" pricing this year. They apparently are/were of the opinion that they have a monopoly in this market and can do whatever the heck they want. I have just two words: H&R Block. I am no longer a TT customer. Maybe I'll come back if they change their tune on this one, but I doubt they will."
736,RC23XE22LQBAB,"Price Gouging - time to make a switch!","Well, it's time to change. I've been a loyal TurboTax user for many years. Before that I used the H&R Block Software. Intuit has raised the prices significantly this year to get the same services I've come to expect over the years. It cost me $63 to submit a pretty basic 1040 with State and efile. That's about $20 more than last year and about $25 more than the competition charges. So long TurboTax, I'll be switching to H&R Block."
737,R3LVLV5ZP9RS30,"Lost my trust","I've used TurboTax for 20 years -- since it was Chipsoft -- but I'm done. Never again. I resent being treated with such contempt. Being forced to upgrade at the time I tried to file meant I had to pay them much more -- even with their partial refund -- than if I'd bought Premier in the first place. Allowing me to enter K1 info, but then refusing to file electronically, is petty. This wasn't an honest attempt at raising prices, it was slimy subterfuge. They've lost my trust after a couple of decades of loyalty. Scott Cook, how could you let them destroy your company like this?"
738,R7F3FPWHS2WQ2,"Yes I could have read all the fine print, but the joy of turbo tax has ...","Same thing I ordered last year but now they require an upgrade to get to all forms at $30. I should have downloaded premier from Amazon and saved $15. INTUIT certainly led me into their trap. Yes I could have read all the fine print, but the joy of turbo tax has been that they lead you through the forms. Now, once you are working through return, they let you know you need more and have to upgrade through them at a premium. I have been a loyal turbo tax user for over two decades, but once I feel cheated...Never again."
739,R31XJZ3PL1JMM5,"TurboTax miscalculates Federal Taxes!","Update: I worked through where the error originated on my state taxes--it starts on the Federal Itemized deductions which flows down to the state forms. TurboTax does not include the state taxes paid on 1099R forms in its calculations (this should be included on Schedule A, Line 5). This in turn flows down to the state tax forms. I just completed manually filing a Amended Federal return (Form 1040X) to correct TurboTax errors! Intuit your quality control is pathetic. My son uses Tax Slayer and is happy and H&R Block is getting positive feedback. All I know is this is my last year using TurboTax. Original note: I purchase the online product. The download and installation went well, So did importing my prior years' tax information. Filing Federal taxes felt much like last year--no issues. Then I went through the state taxes. I have two kids in college so I had to take money out of my IRA to help pay the college bills. I had estimated how much tax would be owed both Federal and State from these withdrawals, so I would have these covered. At the end of the year I had $2,400 paid in state taxes on my 1099 Forms to cover these IRA withdrawals. TurboTax state only included the taxes paid on my W2, not on my 1099s. According to TurboTax I owed the state $2,100 instead of getting $300 refund! Testing the product to ensure the 3 sources of taxes paid the state should have been caught even if Quicken have performed the most basic quality control! The quality control on this product is very poor. The good: - Downloads worked flawlessly and installed cleanly - The prior year tax information imported correctly (from TurboTax 2013) - The Federal return appears accurate The bad: - The state product miscalculates taxes - Quality control remains a huge issue for Quicken I can't recommend this product."
740,R4ZGLIAP01SAM,"Double the Price for the Same Software???","I have been a loyal TurboTax user for 15 years and have used the Deluxe version because I have a small part-time business where I make about $10,000 a year and now they want me to fork out double of what I paid last year to upgrade to the next level? That isn't going to happen and since so many reviewers opposed to TurboTax's price increases have been recommending H&R Block, I am going to save myself money and try H&R."

I've used TurboTax since 2002 and have always told people how great Turbo Tax is (was). Unfortunately, I have decided to switch this year and have already installed my new copy of H&R Block 2014. From what I can tell, it is going to do everything I need for half the cost. Thank you H&R Block, good-bye Turbo Tax!"

Their continuous attempts at up-selling were always annoying, and the tricks about state returns exasperating. But this is just amazing. The price increase of 40 to 60% is the least of it. The real problem is the disingenuous way the increase is implemented, and the questions this raises as to what's next. Can you trust these people? Obviously not. Time to move on to another product. In business integrity, or at least the perception of integrity, is worth a lot. Intuit just tossed away any hint of integrity."

744,R3PR90MFZKUWZN,"fine. But what Intuit has done is outrageous","Pure and simple: Intuit-Turbo Tax has initiated a minimal 60% (sixty percent price increase). What is included in Deluxe in previous years - schedules C, D, E and F - has been omitted forcing many users to purchase either Premier or Home/Office at about $30 more on what was previously a $50 purchase. That is a 60% increase. If they want to bump up the price some nominal amount annually, fine. But what Intuit has done is outrageous. No doubt I will be amongst many loyal Turbo Tax users who will no longer use Turbo Tax in the future. Are you listening Intuit?"

In the last couple of years TurboTax Deluxe has had more and more programming code put in to try and force you to upgrade to a more expensive version. Now it's not just a suggestion, they figure that customer loyalty will work in their favor as they force you to a more expensive version. Time to look for another vendor."
747,R257SK30GUUVIW,"Intuit Drops Important Functionality From Turbo-Tax Deluxe","I have used Turbo-Tax Deluxe to do my taxes since the product's inception and have always lauded its benefits to friends and family. Also, for the last 10 years, I have used Turbo-Tax Business for my LLC company. For those of you who are not familiar with how the taxes work for an LLC, the business generates a very simple K-1 form where the profit or loss passes through to the partner's personal tax return. TT Deluxe always had a field for recording the dollar amount of the profit or loss. It was really that simple -- one field!! Now, I am required to pay an extra $20 for Premier just to be able to fill in that one field. Acceptance of Schedule C, D, E, K-1, etc. is a feature of the software (programming) not the platform. Itâs a shame that TT isnât providing the features in Deluxe across all platforms. Instead, TT chose to drop the functionality all together in the Deluxe version thereby forcing customers to pay for the pricier Premier version which is available across more platforms. The company made this change for one and only one reason -- to increase their revenue/profit. As customers we have to decide if the Premier versionâs price is worth it or if we want to take a chance on a different product. After reading some of the positive reviews about the H&R Block product, Iâve decided to give H&R Block a chance. As a side note, I am also extremely unhappy with Intuitâs Quicken which Iâve used for as long as I can remember. I installed the latest version of Quicken and it crashes every time that I do an online update. The person on the help desk acted as if I was from a different planet saying that she had never heard this complaint before. However, if you do a simple Google search, you will find a multitude of people complaining about the exact same problem. There are forums on the subject! After I pointed this out, she directed me to an Intuit support site on the subject. I followed the convoluted directions to the letter (and I am an IT geek) without success. So I paid over $30 for a product that doesnât work and I have to manually type all of my transactions into Quicken in order to reconcile my bank accounts and credit cards. Something is really wrong with Intuitâs customer service. The customer rep promised to follow up with me, but did not. Sadly, this is something that too often happens when a company is a monopoly. Thatâs one reason why Iâve decided to throw some support at H&R Blockâs way."

Years ago, it incorporated copy protection that made its products nearly unusable. Users revolted, and TurboTax relented. Intuit has now outdone even that. Its 2014 TurboTax product suite forces those with the most modest of side businesses into a product that costs double that of what most formerly used. Intuit could have encouraged users to upgrade by adding enhancements and timesaving features to its higher-end offerings. Instead, it removed from its mainstream products all (Schedule D for capital gains) or most (Schedule C for one-owner businesses) functionality for schedules used by millions. Intuit apparently decided we do not pay them enough to endure their constant pitches for added-cost services, and that it would not make the effort to better market enhanced versions and added services. Instead, they elected to gut its mainstream offering and force users to change to more costly ones. When this became apparent to its millions of loyal users, did Intuit offer a mea culpa as it did with the earlier copy-protection debacle? Absolutely not! This time, Intuit doubled down, insulting us with their claim that this was not to pad their profits, but to improve our user experience. That is absolute, transparent malarkey. I will return tomorrow the recently acquired copy of TurboTax Deluxe from which I thankfully did not remove the shrink-wrap. After more than 25 years, I am looking for a different product. Thanks, Intuit, for rewarding my loyal patronage with a combination of greed, arrogance and deception one receives from politicians and monopolists but seldom from those who must compete for our dollar. P.S. to Bob and Blake: Do you really think I want to talk to one of the associates you have trained to spout drivel similar to yours, and to wait endlessly on hold for that privilege?

754,R3JAVFRCNG70NX,"Recipe for Disaster - it's too late to modify the software","Thanks but no thanks. Intuit's attempt to fix the problem at the 11th hour is a recipe for disaster. Changing the deluxe version to include schedules found in previous years version is not going to go smoothly. People familiar with changes to information technology software or hardware know changes aren't easy. They also need to be tested. This late in the cycle does not allow for testing needed to ensure integrity to the product. TurboTax has definitely lost my business."
755,R2ZI05MDMGTA0Q,"""Bait and Switch"" should be their corporate slogan.","I haven't actually purchased the software physically, but I used the online version as I have a few other years before. Consumer reports tested it out and made it sound like it was cheaper to use the online than to purchase the physical software and file. Their online prices indicated a $34.99 filing fee for federal, which seemed reasonable. I figured there would be a state fee as well, and that would be a convenience factor for whatever that price was. I guessed my total would probably be around the store price of $50-$60. I get done filling out everything and get to the end to pay and the state fee is also $34.99 bringing my total to $70. At this point, do I go to the store and purchase the software and risk hidden filing fees again? No - it's not worth it. As I""m going through tons of finalizing steps, I get to the point where it asks if I want to pay for the filing through my refund or via credit card. I choose through my refund. I'm almost ready to file and I get the summary charges of $104.00. Turns out that in addition to the federal and state, they want to add an ADDITIONAL refund handling fee - as if they haven't already bait and switched enough. Turbo tax might have good software to calculate refunds, but I'm so angry that I spent well over 3-4 hours filling in documents only to find a bait and switch. I'm going back to H&R block like I did last year and will never again use Turbo Tax!"
756,R2ENPEC34EH302,"Nasty surprise for loyal customers","I have been using TurboTax since 1998. Every year I need to file Schedule D, and every year TurboTax has provided that form.

I am self employed and need a Schedule C form and apparently from what I hear TurboTax deluxe no longer has Sch C in the package and it will cost another $40 to get the package that has Sch C. Maybe it is time to entirely move away from Intuit. As mentioned before I've used Quicken since the DOS days and I am getting a bit annoyed at the corporate manor of Intuit. I just got a message from Quicken that after April 2015 I will no longer be able to download from my credit card companies, direct into my credit card accounts I set up on Quicken. I will need to purchase a new version of Quicken if I want to continue having the down load option. This is the third time I've had to update because of the down load issue and it is a BIG strong arm technique to make me buy their software. I think 90% of the abilities in the Quicken (bloat ware as computer geeks would say) is not needed by me. I just need to keep balances of checking / saving and credit accounts.

With Intuit's efforts focused on addressing the lost functionality with the Deluxe version, they seemingly have little time to address other issues. As an example, the one that was particularly vexing for me was on Form 2441, the Daycare Provider worksheet. Erroneous information is generated and is not easily corrected. Although reported weeks ago, Intuit will not release a fix until 2/12. I don't believe Amazon allows links in reviews, so please see Intuit's TurboTax Support forum if you would like further information. I experienced several other issues going through my taxes, and frequently ended up on the TurboTax Support forum. As with the issue associated with form 2441, permanent fixes are slow in coming, and the suggested workarounds may or may not work for a given user. For the very first time as a TurboTax user, I am not confident that my taxes are being created accurately. I would suggest an independent review of the tax forms before submitting them if you are at a medium to high risk for an audit.

After that it's simply price it accordingly and watch the money roll in as they sell millions of copies of the software. Apparently that model doesn't work for them any more. Premier is a stupid segmentation... there are a lot of people who have investments via stock purchase plans, IPO, etc who need the investment option but do not have rental property. I'm not going to spend $80+ when I thought $50 was kind of ridiculous. I'm moving to H&R Block this year... their Deluxe edition was cheaper to start with (I'm about to purchase it for $35 on Amazon) and it's half the price of what I would need from TurboTax now since I would need the Premier edition.

I will be reviewing that decision as well because it is only a matter of time before someone starts messing around with that package tooâ¦"

Instead, I am taking the advice of others and trying H&R Block this year."

I had bought the Deluxe a few weeks and didn't even realize that I won't be able to use it this year until I saw the article in a local newspaper. I called the 800 number provided and they upgraded me to premium without a problem. So far so good. But that still leaves the issue of sneaking in a huge price increase for the same functionality, and all this in the name of improving ""customer experience"". I can live without this improved experience. I would invite Intuit's CEO and CFO to review their marketing organization. It probably needs a new head. Remember, this ""great experience"" comes around every year and it is only so much it can cost before we jump ship or just start doing it manually, which most of us are capable of doing anyway.

791,R28YE2GSYJ4L78,"Intuit shows their contempt for their customers by gimping this version! If you have Capital Gains, DO NOT BUY","As many others have indicated, this product has been purposefully gimped. They removed the ability to submit electronically if you have any capital gains in order to force people to migrate to a more expensive platform. And while they keep saying you can still print and submit your forms, we all know that we don't buy turbotax expecting or wanting to print and mail forms. Clearly they believe they have monopoly powers and I join the many others here in being totally disgusted. To Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, I do not find your rationale that you had to standardize platforms to reduce confusion to be at all compelling considering you only removed the capital gain functionality from the on-line product last year. You created the confusion a year ago. It would have been far less confusing to restore this functionality to the on-line platform rather than gimping the PC platform as well. This move serves mostly to show your disdain for your customers."

793,R2RG15NV5P18KV,"Crippled ""Deluxe"" version","Very sad to see that Turbo Tax has made changes to the ""Deluxe"" edition of their software (you can no longer file Schedules C, D, E, or F). So if you done something as simple as bought or sold stock last year, you'll need to spend about twice the money and ""upgrade"" to Premier. I've been using TurboTax for more than a decade, but this is it. I'm switching to H&R Block. They'll give you a free download if you email them (do a google search for SwitchToBlock). You just need to have a copy of a valid receipt for the 2014 Deluxe Edition of TT. H&R Block software uses the same friendly interview approach and it will import last year's return from Turbo Tax.

I will give them credit. They say they will refund my $30. They also need to fix the sales tax deduction. Look up your states sales tax on the chart. If that is higher than state income tax you get to deduct that. There is also a rule that says if you bought a new car, boat, etc. You can add the sales tax on that to the chart. Well, their interview process completely ignores that. I had to go to their sales tax work sheet in forms. After I had filled out the worksheet in the forms section TT finally gave me the higher sales tax amount. I don't care whether they fix the sales tax problem or not because I won't be using TT next year. I think I might give Tax Slayer a try. I am confident that next year they will up the price to $80 which is more than I am willing to pay."

But what Intuit has done, is despicable. I'm a Quicken customer from the early 90's. I started using TurboTax in the late 90's. The functionality of the Intuit Turbo Tax product has been in decline for the last 3-4 years. This last change is the icing on the cake. Today I started looking for a replacement and guess what I found one! For those that don't know, H&R Block will send you a free download for their equivalent based software based on your Intuit purchase. Read the text and as an EX-Turbo tax user, I'm looking forward in using the Block software. Link -> http://newsroom.hrblock.com/hr-block-offers-free-software-turbotax-users/ Heads will roll at Intuit for this decision.

My brother had told me about H & R Block Deluxe software for two years now, that it does the same thing as Turbotax Deluxe and was also cheaper. Since Turbotax Deluxe worked for me I didn't feel all the price differences (product, extra state download, state efile) were worth switching until now! I've purchased H&R Block's Deluxe from Amazon but have yet to install it. If it works as well as expected, Turbotax will lose another repeat customer.

Your reply is a weasel word infested, banal piece. It says nothing other than ""change is challenging."" Not all change is, you two.

This is a pretty sneaky way to slip this in, but in the consumer world I guess it is ""buyer beware"". I am a registered Intuit TurboTax user, so it would have been nice to get an advisory e-mail that the product I had used in the past was being stripped of features but my guess is Intuit preferred to try to slip this one in once they had my money for the product I had bought for years assuming it would do the job it always has.

TurboTax is going downhill, very fast. I will never spend another dime on TurboTax and no longer will Ever recommend them.

I have since followed the online discussions, read the news reports, explored the alternative programs & considered the âoffersâ Intuit has made to âfixâ things with longtime customers like myself. Most of all I have watched the way they have reacted to this situation. Their response reeks of âwe donât careâ. It has not been an easy decision for me due to the comfort level I had reached using TT over the years, however I realized I have lost my trust in TurboTax & am very uncomfortable supporting the kind of corporation it seems to have become. I have ordered H&R Block software mostly out of principal & already feel better."

But Deluxe isn't what it was. Nope. There are changes and I'm one of the customers who simply assumed Deluxe would be the same this year too. The reviews here have made this obvious, but I didn't read them when I was buying in a store. I simply threw the Deluxe version into my cart and expected TurboTax to maintain its continuity. Now I'm reading reviews about Intuit's sneaky practices that have caused a fairly large customer backlash. I didn't think I'd need to read reviews for a product I've used reliably for 20 years. H&R Block can hardly believe their luck and are offering free software to help with the transition away from Intuit. I'm going to take H&R Block's offer and see how it compares."

I purchased and installed the deluxe version as I have every year, only to then learn I had to pay an extra $30 to upgrade to ""Premier"" to handle basic investments. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Since when would standard investments not be included in a ""DELUXE"" package! Never ever again will I recommend this product, and I will be telling everyone within ear shot to NOT go near the product or company anymore. I feel like a fool as I had convinced many friends over the year of the benefits of this product.

I did not find it any harder to use. Shouldn't after doing my own Taxes for 20 years. As for the TurboTax program, it is probably the same as always.

I am delighted with how easily it imported my data from last year's Turbotax files. I also have to file a number of 1065 returns for businesses and trusts.

No brainer, making the switch! What is interesitng to me is when they(intuit) realize the consequence of this decision, they will have to discount significantly next year to pull back their old customers that switched to H&R Block this year.

Premier is simply too expensive, when I can buy H&R Delux including these schedules for ~$32 here on Amazon. I know one can use the forms approach manually with TurboTax to work-around this change, but to me defeats the simplicity and guidance of the interview, which is why many buy tax software in the first place.

If I didn't want to use my credit card to pay this fee then there was the option to pay out of my refund, but that charge was $34.99. What a racket. Perhaps this little fee slipped my mind from previous years, but I certainly didn't save any money buying Turbo Tax here.

The offer for a free move up to Premier still won't let me help prepare tax returns for a poor self-employed friend who earns less than $15k a year; heaven knows why Intuit thought it would be smart to force those who can least afford it to use their most expensive product or do their returns by hand if they don't want to overpay taxes As a 30+ year CPA, at least 4 other family members will no longer be paying Turbotax this year on my recommendation. In order to get the full functionality we need for all the the types of tax returns we need, TaxAct is the most effective cost option. I'm glad I walked past the year end display at Costco and decided to compare prices before buying Turbotax. Stumbling upon the very low ratings at Amazon was eye-opening. I have also alerted our HR department at the 50,000+ employee organization where I work about the now obvious errors in the e-mail they distributed at work with our employee discount, suggesting that, consistent with prior years, Turbotax Deluxe would be the most cost effective option for most partners and employees, many of whom have significant investment and K-1 income as well as multistate filing obligations. I suspect many of these people will also look elsewhere, if not this year, certainly next year, after they realize that Turbotax Deluxe no longer does anywhere near what it used to and that after inputting nearly all of their information, they will end up paying significantly more for the injury of having to file tax returns in the first place. Time to lobby Congress to let the IRS have its own e-filing program as other countries and many US states do."

Goodbye TT and hello to H&R. ""Raising TurboTax Prices, Intuit Kicks a Hornetâs Nest Intuit, maker of the popular TurboTax tax-preparation softÂ­ware, has infuriated many longÂ­time users by requiring them to buy more-expensive software to complete their 2014 tax returns. Starting this year, people who prepare their taxes on a personal computer canât use TurboTax DeÂ­luxe if they want to electroniÂ­cally file common tax forms, inÂ­cluding Schedule C for a business, Schedule D for capital gains and losses or Schedule E for rental property. Instead, they must upgrade to the Premier or Home & Business versionsâ which cost up to $30 more than the $50 Deluxe version a s of Thursday. Customers with simpler reÂ­turns face a similar issue: They can no longer use TurboTax BaÂ­sic if they want to itemize deÂ­ductions (such as mortgage inÂ­terest or charitable donations) on Schedule A , instead of claimÂ­ing the standard deduction of $6,200 for a single filer or $12,400 for a married couple. Now, they will need to upgrade to TurboTax Deluxe, which costs up to $30 more than the $20 BaÂ­sic. People who use TurboTax to prepare their taxes online faced similar issues last year. As news of the change started to spread two weeks ago, longÂ­time users took their outrage to the Internet. On Amazon.com, reviewers posted more than 1,200 negative comments, comÂ­plaining of âbait-and-switchâ and âprice gouging.â (Journal readers sounded off in a b log post.) âThe company seems intent on fleecing t he customer by inÂ­creasing the price with no prodÂ­uct improvement,â says Don Rickelman, a retired entrepreÂ­neur in Naples, Fla. In the past, he says, he has used TurboTax Deluxe to report his investments, but now, like many other users, he is considering alternatives. TurboTax spokeswoman Julie Miller says customers surprised by the change can call the comÂ­pany at 800-445-1875 and âwe will work with them on a caseÂ­by- case basis.â Several who have called said they were given free downloads of TurboTax Premier. âLaura Saunders The Wall Street Journal """

Silly me--after years of using TurboTax Deluxe I now find that it will no longer work for my needs (I didn't read the small print). The ploy is way more egregious than the typical consumer product downsizing scams. Shame on Intuit--this is the closest thing to fraud that they could legally perpetrate. (update:To clarify--nothing in my tax filing has changed for many years--I need Schedules D and E and sometimes C for minor income--but now Intuit in its cynical wisdom has apparently decided that I should pay an extra $30 in order to have those schedules in full digital glory. So they've basically almost doubled my cost so that I can continue to report less than 10% of my income). Their excuses make no sense whatsoever. This is my last ever purchase of their product."
843,R30QO742XCQBA2,"TurboTax stores our SSN, Name & email in an online database - Hackers are delighted!","I've just read a story on USA Today http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2015/01/27/turbotaxs-database-knows-your-secrets/ that describes how TurboTax has a web site (search the site for ""2014 $25 rebate"") that requires your social security number. This means, that TurboTax has saved your personal financial information (e.g. SSN, Name, email, and more?) and it will be available to hackers online if the database is breached. In light of these security issues, this year I have decided reluctantly to skip TurboTax in favor of H&R Block, and will try TT again next year. I really hope that Intuit gets less greedy (e.g. 50% price hike for Deluxe, and less features across the board) and I hope Intuit becomes less complacent about my personal online security ... in the meantime H&R is ethical, honest, has much better prices and does not price gouge. Am I the only person that is disgusted that Inituit (turbotax) is storing my personal and financial information on its personal servers? In this time of huge Internet security breaches (Target, Sony, Citibank, etc.) I have little or no confidence in the capability of Intuit to maintain the privacy of my personal financial information - especially since it is compliant with low-grade IRS standards that leaves me scared - because, with all the budget cuts, IRS security standards are probably the bare-minimum standard, i.e. crap, right? ... !!! I appreciate that my tax filings must be stored, but I resent that my personal information is potentially compromised online. P.S. Intuit support has openly lied to me several times (10+) when I called to question them about maintaining the privacy of my personal information. They say that they do not store my SSN. They say that the SSN is just there for validation, but they do not store my SSN. This is totally false. If they validate the SSN I type in, then they MUST have it stored somewhere in order to validate against the email/name entered. When I asked how they validate the SSN without having it stored, they eventually caved in and said, yes they do store it - but it is in a secure database - I wonder how much they are lying about that too. Probably the flimsiest cheapest, easy-to-hack security available. Bear in mind that Intuit quickly rushed this rebate to market because of customer complaints (see USA Today story above). It looks like they just went for the laziest, cheap (crap) solution that was convenient for the company, despite compromises to customer security. They are not trustworthy in my opinion."

I've used TurboTax since the mid 1990s to do my taxes - this is the last year for that, in fact I'll most likely just eat my loss on this useless software and go to H&R Block.

I was working on my taxes today and got to where I needed to input data from sale of a second home (on 1099-S) only to find that I was forced to purchase a $30 upgrade in order to file my taxes. When I purchased the software, I read carefully the differences between the versions. There is nothing anywhere on the package that indicates that the Premiere version was required to file my taxes. I have used Deluxe for several years and have always been able to file Schedule C and report sale of second home. There is absolutely nothing on the package that informs the unknowing buyer about what version you need to purchase OR that you will have an in-app purchase. Classic Bait and Switch. Now TurboTax is ""generously"" offering a $25 rebate if 1) you used Deluxe last year, 2) have already filed your taxes and 3) used the CD or download version. But the upgrade is $30. I should not have to pay another penny given that there is nothing on the package to inform me that I should have purchased the premiere version to begin with. Shame on you TurboTax. I can tell you that TurboTax has lost a loyal customer. I have used TurboTax since it was first released. Nevermore. I will never purchase another Intuit product. In fact, I am going to get the free H&R Block Deluxe and try it out this year. Next year I will be using another tax product. I don't care if TurboTax decides to give their product free."
848,R1S1YV7X7TI0B2,"Goodbye Intuit. You made the decision easy.","This is customer disrespect beyond belief--with a huge dose of arrogance. No Schedule D in a ""Deluxe"" version? Are you kidding? But they didn't stop there--you can Go To Forms and SEE the Schedule D--but you can't fill it out manually. And if you want to go old school and fill out Schedule D in IRS-issued paper format and enter the result in TurboTax's 1040 form? Ha--they blocked that too, chump. But they'll gladly upgrade you to Premier for $30 more--all of which Intuit can keep for themselves and share nothing with a retailer. Let me mention that Costco is selling Premier for only $15 over the price of ""Deluxe"". With this as background, go read TurboTax's EULA--do you really want a company like this to have that kind of rights to the SSNs of you and your children plus a complete history of your finances? It's a waste of an Amazon star, but there's no lower rating. Update: It gets even better! Costco let me exchange Deluxe for Premier (again only $15 more compared to Intuit's in-software upgrade for $30.)---Kudos to Costco!. BUT, having started my return in Deluxe and installing Premier, the return only opens in Deluxe even after DELETING Deluxe from my Mac!! Is this a means to get chumps to pay $30 with every cent going to Intuit? Update 24-Feb-2015: Intuit: DON'T BE EVIL !!! After entering all my data offline (I don't like my tax files open while on-line), i discovered it's IMPOSSIBLE to print my tax returns unless I go on-line and use Intuit's ""Secure Printing Service""!!! Guess what? I don't need their lousy, data-collecting secure service, I was going to print wired up to my own printer. How DARE Intuit force everybody to put everything through them....I guess it's off to the Post Office to get the IRS paper forms and transcribe all by Turbo Tax entries by hand. Thanks for nothing Intuit. Good riddance. (I don't believe ANY of those 5 star ratings are genuine...once Intuit started getting pummeled by negative reviews, they probably assigned some people to write positive reviews....Don't be fooled. Here's an answer I found on-line: HOW DOES ONE PRINT FROM THE CD VERSION WITHOUT GOING ONLINE. THE PROGRAM FORBIDS OFFLINE PRINTING. Starting this year, Turbotax CD/download versions will not permit people to print tax forms when offline. If you try to print while not connected to the Internet, you receive the warning ""There was a problem connecting to Intuit's Secure Print Service. Please check your Internet connection or try again later."" Even if you are not interested in connecting to Intuit's Secure Print Service, you cannot print or save to PDF without sharing your entire return first with Intuit. They prohibit you from only printing locally on home, cable-connected printers. The result of this is that people who tried to be safe by never going online with tax data, are this year being forced by Intuit software to expose all their sensitive tax information files to the Internet and Intuit print server, even though they do not wish to. I have spent four days trying to contact customer service without success. If a company really cares about you, they will at least provide a way to contact them."
849,R3E2AS8IURZN88,"Horrible price hike","Last year was my first year filing a US tax return and I was quite satisfied with TurboTax 2013 and was planning to buy TurboTax 2014.

It's a no brainer to use H&R Block Deluxe this year, which costs roughly half and provides the same easy guidance as well as imported my 2013 TurboTax return flawlessly."
850,R34OO8TQ8JQEAI,"If I leave this time, I'm not coming back.","I've been a TurboTax customer since approximately 1997, with the exception of the year TurboTax made its last stupid PR mistake - that of installing a DRM system that prevented me from re installing my software (which I do an average of every other year because of computer changes). I left TurboTax that year for a competitor. I returned the next year, when they retracted their decision and were sincere enough about it for me to trust them again. Now I am faced with a similar dilemma. I use Schedules C, D, and E. Schedule C is for a business that makes a piddling amount of money, but requires mileage deductions which are almost certainly not supported on the downgraded Deluxe version of Schedule C. I have investments that often require the use of Schedule D. I receive $500 in rental income annually (with no applicable deductions) which requires the use of Schedule E. That drives up my price 67% - not because my tax situation has changed over the past 2 decades, but because TurboTax has decided to downgrade the product I have bought for nearly 2 decades solely to extract more money from me. The explanations offered are insulting - that because TurboTax created confusion by offering online and mobile products by the same name that were less functional than its CD based products that its only option to gouge its customers who have been loyal for decades by making our products less functional as well. And - that their failing was that they were not clear about the change (not that they made it in the first place.) No. TurboTax had the option of conforming its online and mobile products to the functionality that has always been part of its flagship product line. That is the choice it should have made - not offering a one time $25 - less in a single year than the ongoing annual markup I will have to pay because they have downgraded the software I have always purchased. My decision on tax software this year is pending - but I'm pretty sure that if I leave via SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com, I will not return. I was impressed with the responsiveness to customer complaints about its last PR nightmare, but that response came after I had already left for the year. But you don't get to drive me away twice and have me come back a happy camper. If TurboTax drives me away this time, it will be permanent."

It gets the job done, is reasonably easy to use and was competitively positioned until 4-5 years ago when the the price began to rise. At the time TurboxTax was more refined than competing products so I was happy to pay the uplift. Around the same time in-product advertising was introduced along with increasingly aggressive up sell pitches and higher fees for electronic filing (especially for state returns). I acclimated to the unwanted noise but the polish was starting to wear off. Then came mandatory Windows services, buggy software on initial release and other installation nuances that soiled the anual experience. Fast forward to this season with a further reduction of functionality (forms) and even higher price points. Ouch. A rare two star rating (""I don't like it"") accurately reflects my feelings toward this product. It will do your taxes but there are far better values. Update: Like others I received Intuit's mea culpa mailings and offer for a free Premier upgrade. I find this less than sincere given Intuit's long history of hammering customers across their product line (I also use Quicken and Quickbooks). And next season I am again faced with purchasing Premier at full retail price. No thanks."

Because we trusted TurboTax and were satisfied with past performance, we subscribed to annual renewals without anticipating a need to read each year's offer with a magnifying glass.

The company has ""dumbed-down"" the Turbo Tax Deluxe version - this year it does not allow you to prepare Sched C D & E which were available in the Deluxe version in prior years. In prior years, Sched C D & E were fully supported by the Deluxe version. Now you are forced to purchase Premier for an additional $30 just to get Sched C D & E. I have simple return but it does required C D & E. The company is clearly doing this to generate revenues and this is not the first time Intuit has disabled functionality or ""dumbed-down"" its software to make consumers purchase software again or pay a higher price for an improved version. I have been a a Quicken and Turbo Tax user for many years - probably over 15 - and I'm now looking at other options. I think the H&R Block tax software is very good and much less expensive. The Sched C D & E are included in the lower priced HR Block software too. I'm now checking to see if my prior year's Turbo Tax files/forms will transfer easily to H&R Block software. If not, I will lose some continuity but so be it. This disabling/gouging strategy by Intuit is not the first time. I think it is insulting to all inteligent consumers to switch pricing in this way and for the most part it is disingenous. I expect the pricing strategy will backfire on them. I could easily afford the Premier version but there is nothing to stop the company from taking the same strategy next year. Maybe next year Intuit's / TurboTax's Deluxe version will only let you file an IRS 1040 EZ and consumers will need to buy a ""super premier"" version at a much higher price to even use the software to file a Sched A."

You made an amazing mistake if you think it is an improvement to degrade a product that has had such a long-term loyal following.

Goodarzi's lame excuse is that ""...we made the product experience consistent across all TurboTax offerings."" in other words, ""It was a good move for us, and if it happens to cost you more, well... that's good for us too!"" I can't wait to see next year's financials, when we'll know the impact of millions of FORMER customers who won't be back (and if Goodarzi survives)!"

It boggles the mind sometimes how stupid companies can be. The competitors must be licking their chops. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. Good bye Turbo Tax."
873,R1USA04ISLYK5X,"Such A Disappointment","I had been using this particular software for at least 10 years and had been happy with it for the first 9. Last year, it would not allow me to efile our state and federal forms, no matter what I did. Being a procrastinator, I waited up until the last minute to complete our taxes and because of the efile failure had to go fight traffic to drop off our returns at the post office, which turned out to be the most unpleasant trip to mail something ever. The traffic was horrible, people were not following the basic traffic laws, and there were so many unhappy filers trying to do the same thing, they were literally jumping out of vehicles in the middle of traffic and running to drop their returns into the bins on the sidewalk = super dangerous! Was willing to overlook the problems from last year and buy this again, until I read the reviews and learned about the price increase and removal of items my family needs to file properly. Have switched to HR Block Deluxe after reading recommendations and the more reasonable price. Will review that one when taxes are done."

I am sure that they will make the so-called ""free"" upgrade as difficult as possible so people will give up and pay the ransom."

Hope Intuit realizes the loss of a customer that will never be back."
877,RMFWTXI34KJ2B,"Time to break the TurboTax monopoly.","I've been a loyal TurboTax customer for many years, but it has long bothered me how Intuit keeps jacking their prices up until it's almost like you could have hired an accountant to do your taxes. It is easy to use software, but I'm going to try H&R Block for 2014. Intuit has taken their customers for granted a little too long. I'm also really disturbed that in spite of the fact that I selected the option to keep all my personal data on my PC that Intuit has stored my data, including my social security number and lots of details an identity thief would love to get their hands on, and Intuit keeps it in a data base. I never authorized them to do this. It turns out that since you ""e-file"" using their system, they have to keep a copy, but they should have disclosed this, and they should bend over backwards to assure customers that our data won't go the way of customer data at all the other big companies that have suffered data breaches in recent years."

I did not realize until after I had purchased the product that TurboTax had made such a bad choice on product design. I assume they thought users would upgrade to Premier to get basic Schedule C/D utility. I contacted the TurboTax Customer Service # provided by Bob Meghian to let them know of my dissatisfaction. After they confirmed that I was a long term user they gave me an upgrade code to take my installed Deluxe to Premier. They clearly told me that next year I would need to purchase Premier. So I'm happy that Turbotax made this right but it took 25 minutes of my time online to get this done. I sincerely hope that TurboTax product developers listen to the outcry of long time users and reconsider making this a permanent change going forward. If they do then there are many users that might try H&R block or other online options. The cardinal rule of brand loyalty is not to give your competitors a chance to get their customers to switch. Unless Intuit wakes up they could lose a huge part of their customer base. Schedule C/D is a very basic part of the tax code and to think you've got to go to the Premier level to get it is just ridiculous."
879,R1XP5TRQPXGCQD,"It's not personal, it's business--and that goes both ways","I've have no problem with a business charging more for its products than its competitors. I also have no problem jumping ship to that competitor. Like many others I've been using TurboTax for years, and like many others, I'll be switching to TaxCut this year. I think part of Intuit's miscalculation is that tax software purchases are a matter of habit. Even if the value proposition to the new price breakdown were justifiable, the mere fact that customers are forced to reexamine the product comparison charts means that a good chunk of them are also going to now take the time to a look at the feature comparison charts and reviews of competitor products when in years past they would have just bought what they were in the habit of always buying. So while I won't be jumping on the ""Shame on you, Intuit"" bandwagon, I will add my one Amazon star to the collective ""Intuit Dope Slap""."

They have almost too many versions of quickbooks to count, and within each of those versions, there are sub-versions that you also need to purchase. I have used Turbotax for almost 10 years, and have been happy that the ""remove then charge extra for"" mentality of the features was left alone with this product - until this version. Intuit has removed more functionality in this release, and makes you purchase add-ons for another $40. I'm done with being nickel and dimed by Intuit. After purchasing this version and seeing this, I'm also done being an Intuit customer of their quicken for my home expenses, and quickbooks at my business.

This year that all changed when I got my ""Where are all schedules I need ??? Did you download the wrong thing????"" That sent a shiver up the old spine and I jumped to and started researching what changed in Deluxe. As you all know I'm out of luck unless I pay for an update or get some sort of divine grace for the TT folks. I""m in software and this isn't how you treat customers. TT has lost my trust. I probably will bite the bullet this year but then load my entire return and convert it to HR Block's software. That will give my wife time to get comfortable and put us in position to make an informed decision next year. Since my kids will have jobs soon (hopefully) TT just booted more than just us since my kids and family all rely on my wife's help. No big deal I guess just half a dozen customers for HR Block.

Bought Deluxe weeks ago thinking, all is OK, then tonight go to start the return. Upgrade -NO THANKS! Thought - they ALWAYS try to get me to do it every year - NO THANKS. Wait - FORCED TO UPGRADE - YES, FORCED!!!!!!!! Then to say - oh, thanks for using Deluxe last year- we will give you a $25 rebate?? Isn't there something about bait and switch? I like others will be checking out the free switch to HR Block that they are offering when you email them a paid receipt or software code if downloaded. Such a disappointment from Intuit & Turbo Tax, guess I shouldn't be surprised about the screw over the customer attitude.

And I think they are misguided if they think even their loyal customers don't object to a huge price hike, to buy a different product (""Premiere"" ) to get the same functionality they had in years past with the ""Deluxe"". There is nothing Premiere about filing a Sch D. I started using Turbo Tax when it first came out on floppy discs, it was $5 I think, and I got Quicken free if bought together. Even faithful users will leave if provoked this badly. I sounds like H and R Block has a very suitable replacement. That was a really bad move on Intuit's part. What were they thinking?"

Count me as another lost customer. Since I am not rich I have used TurboTax Deluxe for years to file all my tax returns. This year I purchased TurboTax Deluxe, again, without reading the fine print (my mistake) regarding Schedule D. I soon discovered that I should have bought Premier but had already opened Deluxe and could not return it. Had to upgrade online to Premier which cost $30 for the upgrade. Yes Intuit has apologized and offered a $25 rebate--but the online upgrade cost $30. Read the terms and conditions of this offer. It is not a simple or easy procedure. No doubt that it was deliberately designed to discourage applications for rebate. Next year everyone should investigate the cost of hiring someone to complete your tax returns. Consider the time you will save by paying someone else to complete your tax returns vs the cost of TurboTax and the hours of time that you spend reading instructions and completing the forms. My guess is that those of us who have been using TurboTax have been working for less than minimum wage. If I do decide to complete my own tax returns next year I will using a competitor's product."

But this bait and switch is an insult to all of us. Here's my message to Intuit: price increases I understand and can accept as part of the cost of doing business but pulling a stunt like this shows us you have to be deceitful in order to take our money. That is why we are no longer supporting your product. Fortunately this odious event made me explore other options and I found that H&R Block Deluxe has all the features I need and is significantly less expensive; it's even less than what I paid last year for TurboTax.

Last year, I was unable to install TurboTax 2013 on my desktop system at home, running Windows XP. I spent over an hour with various Intuit tech support people to no avail. I ended up having to install it on an old laptop (also running WinXP). Not ideal... A couple weeks ago, I received my 2014 TurboTax software disc from my preferred seller, and attempted to install it. No go. Got a cryptic error message. Tried Googling the message, went through the countermeasures listed on TurboTax's website....NoGo. Same error message. Just tried installing it again so I could give details of the error message in this negative review, and got a DIFFERENT error message. It now says ""Sorry but TurboTax 2014 cannot be installed on your computer because you need Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed."" Ummm...I'm no longer running WinXP. I'm running a new box I assembled earlier this year, running 64 bit Windows 7 Pro. This year's software is too stupid...too dysfunctional to even begin installing on my computer. Disappointing, to say the least. Prior to last year, TurboTax would install without fail. No jumping through hoops, no need to install this-or-that piece of software prior to running the setup program. No need to make multiple phone calls to tech support staff here in the US or the Philippines. Their software is broken, and they apparently didn't care about TESTING it before releasing this year's garbage. Helloooooooooooo, H&R Block?"

TurboTax has become greedy and will charge whatever the market will bear. It's not going to get better with them, only worse. Switch to H&R Block now.

Halfway though entering some data in the 2014 version, I got a popup telling me I had to upgrade the version I have been using for years. Because I was planning for a quarterly tax payment, I was over a barrel and did the upgrade. That is it. I am done. Without a refund for the upgrade, Intuit has lost me as a customer next year. This topic has come up at several on-line forums for consultants, and the anger seems to be universal. Intuit has really blown it. The comments here say 'call us to make it right'.

After Turbo Tax sprung the last surprise on users several years ago (when the CD was limited to one machine download - creating a major hassle since I worked at home and in my office on my return) this is a surprise but probably shouldn't be. I imagine that just like the last idiotic move, and after losing many customers because of it, they may back track next year (such as when they discontinued the one maching download after just one year). But its too late. I may take advantage of HR Blocks offer to transfer over for free. This is a simple business decision for Turbo Tax. When you have such a significant market share, raise the price.

But then it's even worse when you realize that you've been ""had"" by a company that you have been a loyal customer of for as long as they made it easy to file your own taxes. I guess that loyalty means different things to different folks. At last count, there were already 1,485 customers who gave this product one star (""I hate it"".) If you subscribe to the 10x rule of thumb, there are already 14,850 Amazon customers who have vowed to switch - and it's just January 20th.

In more recent years, the Schedule C & C-EZ interface has been somewhat buried, but still usable. Now this... I find the current omission of such self-employment aids, along with the Schedule D abandonment inexcusable.

""Free-file"" wasn't free last year (2013) since I had a Schedule C, but since I was still unsure about the widow(er) filing status I forked over the $50-60 plus another $19 for the state. Today I went through all of my entry and it would have cost me $116! I didn't believe it possible, so came to Amazon to see how much it would be to buy the disks with free Fed filing. I'm blown away. I went to IRS . GOV, clicked the ""free-file"" logo, selected H&R Block and completed my taxes in a short amount of time -- Schedule C and all. State filing cost $16 including tax.

Yes, you can print them and manually fill them out and mail, but Intuit advises against it. I don't recall Intuit having the courtesy and professionalism to send me an email telling me this, do you? After all, Intuit has email addresses (if unchanged) of all previous `loyal' users on file. And if I wanted to do my taxes manually, I would have no need to purchase tax software. What a disgrace! I would like to know whose `bright idea' it was to offer less value and charge $30 more for the Premium edition to electronically file the aforementioned Schedules. Other companies have learned the hard way that you should never fool with `the old family recipe;' it came back to haunt them. It is now Intuit's turn to reap the repercussions. Intuit was `hoist by its own petard,' i.e., a victim of its own actions. Too bad Intuit - you have lost another `loyal' customer. No matter what their refund or appeasement policy is, I will not be party to it. This was perhaps one of the dumbest business decisions ever made by any company. PS If you have already purchased a boxed copy of TT2014, take it back or return it to where you purchased it. The retailer I dealt with said they have had many, many returns in exchange for other tax software. I exchanged mine for H&R block's Deluxe edition and got a $15 credit!

I've been reluctant to change to the cheaper H&R Block tax software because I was fearing the change and learning curve. But, Block software is easy to learn and similar to Turbo Tax. I've used the free on-line version for years for my kids' returns and I've had no difficulties. Why Intuit ( Turbo Tax) decided to remove fairly commonly needed forms and yet still call this the ""Deluxe"" feature is a mystery or better stated. . . a big goof. I've read that Intuit is offering $25 rebates if you bought Deluxe and if you bought Deluxe last year and if you now need to upgrade to the Premium edition in order to have the same features as Deluxe had in the past. Too late for me, I've already switched to H&R Block. For others, even with the rebate H&R Block Deluxe is cheaper and does the same thing. You can even import your Turbo Tax files from last year.

I had no idea that Deluxe would no longer handle my investments. I'm not self employed and I do not own my own business. I am just an average Joe who is investing for retirement. I should not need more than Deluxe to do my taxes. Just like Crest toothpaste and Heinz ketchup.... TurboTax has been a part of my life.

The offer comes in the wake of a change in forms available to TurboTax Basic and Deluxe clients. Many TurboTax clients are discovering the products theyâve used for years will no longer support their tax needs without additional paid upgrades. The biggest change TurboTax made in their forms coverage ***is no longer supporting Schedule A*** in their Basic product. Taxpayers who itemize deductions and use forms for mortgage interest, charitable donations and Health Savings Accounts will now have to upgrade to TurboTax Deluxe, a $40 increase in price. However, the 30 percent of DIYers who file a Schedule A can use H&R Block Basic software, normally $19.95, to access Schedule A forms. H&R Block Basic users will also receive a 5 percent bonus on top of a federal refund when the taxpayer puts some or all of their refund on e-gift cards from more than 40 retailers.""

To resolve this problem I have changed over to Money Dance for my ""book-keeping"" and have also made the change to TaxAct.

I despise management's deceptive method of forcing consumers into purchasing a more expensive product by removing forms that have been a TurboTax Deluxe staple for over twenty years. The apology, which blames the deception on the need to consolidate products, is a crock. Not for a minute do I believe that the use of online and mobile TurboTax apps require this type of modification to their core product. The bait and switch move is simply a way for greedy management to increase income and thereby justify their salaries to shareholders. Mr. Goodarzi's ""We messed up"" letter only occurred because so many people were outraged by his surreptitious price hike.

Many of us will require the schedule D functionality and I find it hard to believe the folks at Intuit would make this kind of money hungry decision.

971,R1I70GUYQ3RA86,"No loyalty. Period.","As somebody who is resistant to change, I dread what must be done. Unfortunately, TT deluxe was purchased by a household member this week with no knowledge of the 2014 limitations. Fortunately, it has not been opened, so it can be returned. I even had no idea until this morning. I wasn't aware of the buzz until tonight. I will acknowledge that I thrive on routine. I thrive on planning. I like status quo. I have been using TT since at least 1997, it has been like a well worn path that I can fly along confidently. But this weekend I will be purchasing HRB. I was not even aware of the TT changes until I received the email from TT. I am not exaggerating when I say that I was numb. It was partially due to the change, and partially due to how it was handled. By the time I was done reading, I was checking the bottom of my shoes because something smelled awful. Dishonesty on top of deceit, insult added to injury. The attempted spin was so incredulous, that's what made me numb, that somebody would think I was that ignorant. I suspect that those using Deluxe for the schedules are more likely to be able to afford the additional cost, and less likely to have time to re-do their filing...especially after entering all of their information. As unscrupulous as it is, it was a very slick move. I work for a software company, in charge of development. I have to think of how to improve the software, I have to evaluate suggestions from customers, and integrate these, so that the software can evolve to keep up with present times. If I were to remove an integral function of the software, and tell customers that this is now only available for an additional fee, I am pretty sure that I would lose my job. Do I WANT to switch to HRB? No. But after reading about their offer of free software to TT purchasers, I realized that they really want customers. Hopefully a business that is willing to give away software to acquire new customers will be a business that will make an effort to keep customers. I'm sure that using different software will be cumbersome. But next year, it will be easier, and the year after that, even more so. HRB, stay loyal to me, and I will reply in kind! I did read that if I called them and kept pressing for a free upgrade, that I would get it, but if I had time to jump through hoops, I might as well file taxes manually."
972,R3STJDIKQM5ROX,"Intuit needs to learn how not to damage customer loyalty.","If I could give zero stars to this version I would do so, primarily because of Intuit's attitude toward its customers. I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for more than 20 years. It has always had Schedule D. Yesterday when I started to do my taxes I discovered that Schedule D is missing. Of course, for another $30 I can get that schedule. So, basically my software is useless to me unless I accept their bait-and-switch tactic. They have a support phone number but good luck getting past the music. This is poor way to treat loyal customers. I would sooner throw away the software and switch to H&R Block then reward this kind of behavior. Post-script: To be fair, after waiting on the phone for about 30 minutes, I got through to a Turbo Tax agent who had undoubtedly heard versions of my complaint many, many times before I called. She was polite and efficient. She determined what forms I need and upgraded my software to Home and Business at no charge. I told her about the second program I bought for my daughter, who will have the same problem, and the agent promised to send me a free upgrade on a new disc. Clearly, Intuit is feeling the heat. If the complexities of the tax code required an increase in the price of the Deluxe addition I could understand an increase in the price. But that is not what Intuit did. We will see what they do next year as to whether I will stay with Turbo Tax or switch."

But now I see that they are splitting off sections of the return and making you pay more if you do such common items as own stock, or do a small business (aka schedule C). After tearing my hair out reading their info both on amazon and at the intuit site I finally broke down and called them. All I wanted to know was if I could access schedule C through the 'forms' tab on either deluxe or premier. Sadly for their operator I don't think anyone had ever trained her anything about the product or tax software. IN theory I could get access to a hobbled down version of schedule C to be used for ""minimal"" income. What is minimal I asked?> $5, $50, $500, $5,000? She did not know. I asked for a supervisor. She checked and of course no one could talk to me but the supervisor did not know either. I pointed out that schedule C is a standard 4 page form everyone uses. If they do the code for it for their expensive version (which used to be included in the simple version), they have to Pay someone extra to write the code to hamper it- but then they charge less for a product that cost them more to make. I have never seen a company that wants to go out of business the war Intuit does. The money they spend on trying to explain all the differences between versions must be immense, yet they continue to produce a watered down product, charge us more for it, and drive away customers. Does the CEO have a clue as to what is going on? Or does he just want a solid gold helicopter before the company crashes and burns? So after my request for info, and then my complaint, she says she will just give me the expensive version for free (rather than find out the answer). She says next time I log on to my intuit account I can download it. Guess what?!?! Yep. its not there."

Every year I get e-mail from them wanting me to buy their product. If they had any desire for customer retention they would have sent an e-mail telling us that they had removed critical funtionality that many of us had come to expect. They did not. Their e-mail simply says: ""The interview support for certain tax situations in our TurboTax products has changed. Before you choose a product, we suggest you make sure it's right for your specific tax needs. See product comparisons to find out more."" In other words, Caveat Emptor, or were gonna stick it to you and it's your fault if you fall for our ploy and deception. My loyalty has eneded, and today I ordered H&R Block.

I downloaded the software after purchasing it on Amazon and immediately began the process. Let me first say that it is immensley user friendly. It honestly guides the user through the questions and I think it's great for anyone who becomes overwhelmed with filing their taxes. I also enjoyed the ticker at the top that estimates your refund/payment and changes as you enter new information. At the end of the process when I was about to efile my return, I was given a bill for $54.98 with the charges of: Turbo Tax Virginia State E-file Fee $19.99 Refund Processing Service Fee $34.99 I just want to ask what was the $39 that I originally paid for? I get it that everyone looks for opportunities to upsell but I really feel taken advantage of. I purchased a product that states efile is included... if it's included there shouldn't have been a refund processing service fee. Please be more forthcoming with the price. Update: I called to ask what the $34.99 charge listed as Refund Processing Fee was for and was told that I choose to pay the $19.99 Virginia State E-File Fee from my refund versus paying it with a credit card and that is the reason for the charge. I said that I understand but I didn't see an explanation for this when I made the decision; if I would have known that paying with a credit card would have been free of extra charges versus an extra charge for paying from the return, I would have gladly paid with a credit card. He said that was a common problem that people had. I'm not sure if the problem is due to my ignorance but I really think that they made everything so well explained throughout the process of filing, I am sure they could have done a better job of explaining this.

I guess that after 15+ years of loyalty to TurboTax, it is now time to look for alternatives.

Although I never found what the asterisk meant but I am sure we all know what it means now. Seperating it out into more products takes an already confusing process for a lot of your customers and makes it even more confusing.

If they are, they are doomed anyway, because most customers will switch software or take their business to a tax professional before they buy in to TT's new price structure. By the way, having designed considerable hardware and some software along the way to retirement, I feel qualified to submit that TT most likely designed the FULL version first, and then had to spend more design time to back out features to produce the second CRIPPLED version. From that point, the cost of reproducing the CDs and packaging for either version was the same.

Then, after the peasants revolt, they promise to rebate $25 after a return is filed. It actually costs TurboTax essentially nothing to provide the upgrade download, so they immediately pocket at least $5 more from the customers they have previously insulted. It's at least $5 more because it is easy to complicate any rebate program enough so that most people never actually collect it. It would be interesting to see how those numbers end up. In addition, they know that by forcing a Federal filing before allowing the rebate, they have an excellent change of collecting a state e-file fee of another $20 dollars. Again, this costs TurboTax almost nothing, so most of that money goes straight to the bottom line. With H&R Block offering their equivalent software free to the victims of this charade, it's hard to justify trusting Intuit's clueless management with my financial data, let alone pouring even $1 more into their coffers."

Over the years I have had several issues with using TurboTax all of which fell of deaf ears. In the earlier years my chief complaint was that they kept changing the user interface; actually that continues to this day. Now add on the problem that they put advertising right in your program so you have to continually be pimped to upgrade your product, which they will happily do so for a fee. This year after finding out that the Deluxe no longer has Schedule D and with all my issues I had last year using your product I decided to jump ship before TurboTax went out to sea. I have heard that the H & R Block product will import my tax data. I am not to happy about having to jump ship, and frankly wish that I had done it sooner with the shabby product that TTAX.EXE has become. Ever since TTAX was taken over by Intuit years ago the product has been less functional and more commercial. It is sad that we have to leave a product that we used to trust. Maybe just maybe Intuit will get the message and produce a clean product next year; get rid of their advertising; and tell us what is under the hood. There truly is no way anymore to tell just what the various versions of TTAX are capable of doing prior to purchase. Also as H & R Block was smart enough to have import of TTAX data. INTUIT AFTER FIXING YOUR CRIPPLED PRODUCT YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE IMPORT OF H&RBLOCK DATA as many of us have left your shores. Lastly TAXES are stressful enough without having to worry if your software is up to the job, or that your software company is going to nickel and dime you for ""UPGRADES"" that are nothing more than putting back what they have taken out from last years product.

I rated H&R Block software a 1. Although I was very disappointed with the way Quicken handled the TTax changes this year, I have to say that I used TTax for years for a reason - the questions were clear, additional info was readily available, and the software accurately calculated information. I can't say the same for H&R Block and if I had not caught the mistakes I made due to unclear questions or that the software itself made, it would have cost me far more than the price difference between these programs.

It's best if you know how to do your taxes and use the program for convenience and to avoid careless mistakes. That's why I purchased it over the years. The fact that current versions won't open old returns (MS Word, Excel and numerous other programs open old documents), the initial screen that almost demands personal data for marketing purposes, and the requirement to constantly load updates (likely bug fixes) when the program is run, among other items, eliminate the product from A-team status."

Almost every modification TurboTax has done over the years made it less and less consumer friendly. In a few of those years, the changes were very problematic. This year's mods, though, take the cake for being 100% corporate, self-serving, revenue driven crap. There is not a single feature of the new lineup that is customer driven. The new packaging even avoids any mention of whether filings (federal OR state) are free. Hell, there is even no mention of whether the software will even DO filings. That makes me wonder just what Intuit is trying to tee up for the future. If you are new to the use of tax preparation software, do yourself a huge favor and look at one of the other providers.

I explained that if such a big change was included in the product that it should be more clearly explained on the marketing and descriptive info for the product.

The rep was very nice when I said that I needed a work around so that I could complete an estimate for my taxes.

I didn't fall for Intuit's $25 rebate gimmick to upgrade to premier, which would likely keep me on their inflated price Premier product in future years. I made the switch to H&R Block Deluxe this year, and so far it has worked great and even imported my Turbo Tax files from 2013.

I download the software, installed it from Amazon without issue. I imported my 2013 TurboTax Deluxe tax file without issue, just as I had done with TurboTax. So far the H&R product looks and behaves just like TurboTax Deluxe. So I think I have been paying too much to do my taxes over the years and will now ditch TurboTax Deluxe in favor of H&R Block.

I read over 100 and while I understand some of the points by Intuit I believe that it would be better to create another version to remove functionality and leave your most POPULAR product alone. Or as many have pointed out, why not IMPROVE your most popular product rather than diminish it. I am not sure what I will do but I can tell you that I would have been very disappointed and upset had I purchased the TT Deluxe and found out about the schedule D issues when I went to file.

This year with the removal of features but keeping the price the same or increasing it was the last straw for me. The fact that they are trying to lobby for laws that would keep the tax code complex and expensive (see below for more info) lets me know they do not have my best interests in mind. The fact that in Quicken they force you to upgrade every several years or they will disable parts of your program lets me know they are trying to get every penny possible out of me and will go to extremes to do it. What software company goes into your old program and disables parts of it to force you to upgrade? Enough ranting... So I had a lot of data with TurboTax and I was nervous it wouldn't transfer over to another company. Well I read great reviews from other former TurboTax users when they used H&R block. So I took the dive and it worked very smoothly and quickly. It was like I never even switched programs. I'm so glad I switched and am finally free of a company that I feel is trying to bully me out of my money. I don't even care if Turbotax gets desperate and gives the software away for free at this point. I'm glad to be finally free of them and their nasty surprises. Now I just have to find an alternative to quicken before they disable my software. From Wikipedia: Opposition to return-free filing Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, spent more than $11 million on federal lobbying between 2008 and 2012. Intuit ""opposes IRS government tax preparation,"" particularly allowing taxpayers to file pre-filled returns for free, in a system similar to the established ReadyReturn service in Califronia. The company also lobbied on bills in 2007 and 2011 that would have barred the Treasury Department, which includes the IRS, from initiating return-free filing. An Intuit spokeswoman said in early 2013 that ""Like many other companies, Intuit actively participates in the political process."" She said that return-free filing had ""implications for accuracy and fairness in taxation.""[18][19] In its 2012 Form 10-K, Intuit said that ""We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.""[18]"

It's bad enough that they don't include the questions in their question and answer version, but they do not allow us to fill out these forms directly as many of us prefer to do and often do using the IRS.com forms for special cases. I can download TT deluxe for free from Vanguard and have done so and have seen their ""Do Not File"" entries on the forms we wish to use. I could do my taxes for free using CCH's Tax Wise (as a AARP tax prep volunteer), but the tax history in my previous TT returns for MLPs, Form 8206 and other entries, would take much extra time and effort. The limitation excuse for Schedule C to $100 of expenses is particularly egregious. Most of the additional features for your Home & Business schedule C are totally unecessary for most small businesses which can use section 179 to eliminate the need for depreciation schedules and fill in the Schedule C income and expense line items themselves. Turbo tax marketing management, shame on you. It's no wonder you have apparently discontinued your customer focused ""Inner Circle"" program."

Recently, they told me over the phone that there will be a free upgrade coming out in early February due to the uproar from so many customers. We'll wait and see.

TT has had a history of apparent disdain toward its users and there was an incident about five years ago that made me bail after several years of using TT. I would rather pay more than for another product to have been treated that way. I am convinced I made the right decision to leave TT about five years ago and their cooperate behavior hasn't changed after all those years. They have a right to do what they did but we have the right to give them one star ratings and go somewhere else. This reminds me when one hotel charged a guest a fine of $150 for posting a negative review on TA. You can imagine what happened to the reviews after that.

I used if before 1994 but moved and threw the older boxes out. However with the recent problem (need to spend more $ to get the same features in Deluxe) I did not want to do it. Too bad, their software works great! Trust is hard to earn and easy to loose. Intuit's recent attempt to recover from the bad press by giving a $25 rebate still does not give me any confidence. What's next? So I switched to H&R and while i have not yet filed my taxes, the program is working well and is easy to use. It is also a bonus that the H&R version is noticeable less expensive than the turbo tax deluxe too.

I can't believe in the age of e-everything that the ""free"" option is using a dead-trees form that humans have to transcribe, but every time the government tries to offer a free online tool, Intuit sues them for competing.

Same thing with investments. With this new version, Intuit has completely changed the functionality of the product and they are taking advantage of their customers. I refused to pay the upgrade fee they require and switched to H&R Block software. That seems to work fine and I plan on sticking with it for future years as well.

But when I bought my first home and started planning for my retirement, I wanted to really save money and look out for my own interest. So with my brother's advice, I got TurboTax. It was nice and all, but even from the beginning I noticed tricks of hidden costs to get the consumer to pay more. The wording they use in the software were obviously created by copywriters to play into the fear of people who don't know a thing about taxes. So the Audit Protection plan for an additional $50 now so you don't have to pay a CPA $2000 to protect you from the IRS later is just the perfect ploy to sucker people into willingly give them $50 for nothing in return. But what infuriates me more is the fact that they have the audacity to charge you an additional $20 to file your state tax when the front of the box and in the program that you get 1 free state tax return, only to be charged $20 so you can file electronically through their program. Are you serious? And to add more salt to the wound, they wanted another $40 so you can get a refund electronically by IRS for your federal refund. Swear to God, I'm only using this stupid program because it made importing last year's tax return to this year's form so easy. But I've had it with this scam company. They're not getting my money anymore. I'm gonna look into other companies next year.

Income from my job, normal retirement/health savings account/savings funds, housing & charity deductions and a small money-market type investment with Edward Jones. I read through and tried to understand to make sure I was okay with Deluxe. Ha! That 'small' investment means I should have bought Premier. I called the hotline, they upgraded me for $10. I hope Intuit enjoys that $10, that's the last money I'm sending their way. I'm so irritated. The (very nice) person on the hotline mentioned TurboTax knows they did a poor job of marketing it.

But two lingering questions remain: 1. What about all the people who bought Deluxe from ""bricks and mortar"" stores and are unaware of this option? I've already had two friends tell me they bought theirs but had yet to discover either the cutbacks you've made or the (one-time?) solution you've posted here. Unless you publicize this option elsewhere for their benefit, you'll wind up with a lot of even more unhappy former customers. What are you doing to reach out to them? Can you afford to ignore and alienate them? 2. Your explanation of consistency/functionality in each version is still weak. For example, why not remove Schedules F and J, for people with farm-related income? (I'm sure a much greater percentage of Deluxe users have no need.) And what about people with no children, to eliminate 2441/8615/8812/8814 and all the other child-related forms? Look at this from the customer's point of view: I always used Deluxe, and since my situation hasn't changed, I would plan to continue to use Deluxe. Unless you announce that Deluxe may no longer have all the features they need, telling people to ""look at the chart"" is silly advice for customers who have bought the same version year after year (and whose situations haven't changed). A growing number of people are angry, and they don't have short memories. As the old saying goes, ""one burnt, twice cautious."" What are you doing to reach out to them? As I said, I appreciate your sending me H/B for free. However, your chief competitor has offered me their Deluxe product (with all of the features of legacy TT Deluxe and which has always been more reasonably priced) as well, and although it will take me more time, I plan to use and compare both apps to see whether it's worth my while - or anyone's - to pay for your steep upgrade path next year and the year after. Or will we be grandfathered? Bob, I applaud your involvement in this discussion, and I offer these comments as constructive dialogue, to try to make sense out of this. This is not Intuit's finest hour. It has already become a case study in marketing circles. It's not too late to keep it from going from bad to worse."

1116,R1I1SWUA4SDKRC,"More expensive versus competition and now with even less features","I had been a TurboTax user for 11 years straight until 2003 when Intuit decided to include malware in their TurboTax 2002 program [ see: http://www.extremetech.com/computing/53054-turbotax-customers-strike-a-blow-against-intuit ] Even though Intuit tried to screw over their customers back then, I would still foolishly include them on my list of contenders when shopping for and comparing the various tax programs each year. But every year since 2003 I've found myself going back to H&R Block Deluxe (used to be called TaxCut back then). This year will be no different. Not only has H&R Block Deluxe been less expensive to purchase than TurboTax Deluxe year after year, but this year it includes ALL the features (such as Schedule D for reporting capital gains and losses) that Intuit removed from their Deluxe version. This makes H&R Block Deluxe an even bigger win in my book. I strongly suggest TurboTax users give H&R Block a try. I have had zero problems with them and when I compare their results with that from TurboTax online (I just plug in the numbers without filing the return) to verify H&R Block's accuracy, everything is 100% the same. In the end I can't really fault Intuit for their decision to raise prices and remove features. I mean, someone needs to cover the big pay raise and bonuses Intuit executives received in 2014 vs 2013 and prior years [ see: http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/executive-compensation.action?t=INTU ]."

I always receive the same error message: Gateway Error 810. A little research on the interweb leads me to believe that software & game download problems are common when purchased from Amazon. I would think that Amazon's support would address these complaints and take appropriate actions. Until then, I will avoid future software purchases. Amazon did refund my money however."

Intuit's decision to remove features previously available makes no sense except as a strategy designed to force TTD users to ""upgrade"" to TurboTax Premier at an additional annual cost of $30. Well, I don't need or want Premier, and I don't like Intuit's greed. So, sayonara, TurboTax. I'm switching to H&R Block."
1119,R9DE9CYDZZLT4,"After 20 years with Turbo Tax, I've switched to H&R Block tax software.","I realize TurboTax wants to maximize its profits, but it is doing so at the expense of its loyal customers by disabling Schedules C, D, and E in an attempt to force customers to spend another $20 on the Premier product. And Turbo Tax's suggestion that you use forms view to fill out and print out Schedule D along with the rest of your return and mail it to the IRS is no real solution at all - electronic filing and near immediate verification from the IRS that they received my return is a large part of the reason I file online."
1120,R17AU67FR0PGPK,"Supporter of good businesses","Last year I was a previously 15 year user of TaxCut, who switched to TurboTax because they included the EV tax credit form. TaxCut worked well for me, and I thought that despite the higher price, I was going to continue to use them. Today I come to buy my 2014 software and I'm so thankful that I read the reviews. Yes, for many years I used the Schedule C and many other forms, with no problem with H&R Block. Now I see that they pull all this stuff from the ""Deluxe"" version of TurboTax? That's just crazy. Pull them from ""Basic"" but not deluxe. So, rather than support a company that is getting too big for it's britches, I'm going back to order H&R Block, as I was happy with them with everything until they missed the EV tax credit form. Read the reviews on Amazon for yourself..check out the number of stars for TaxCut Deluxe 2014 Federal and State, vs TurboTax Deluxe Fed and State.

But as with everything I purchase at Amazon, I always read the reviews. And they are usualy pretty accurate. Specially when the number of reviewers is this high. The 5 stars and the one stars. I'm pretty chocked on how many people took their time to write bad reviews about this year's TT. Over 1000 people can't be wrong. Right now I see a 1,200 bad versus 50 great. It does tell me something. So here is my question...I know this is not a forum, but how many of you did move to H&R Block and are completely satisfied? How easy was the import from turbo tax process? Did you really save money on the software? Do they offer the audit protection (for a small fee)? Also, Turbo Tax, are you listening to your customers? I know you did change policies in the past (state filing charges and number of federal allowed), so it might be time to reconsider this one. It's still January and I think you can fix this one."

Although they have angered me in the past, nothing they have done has surprised me as much as their decision to drop support for mutual fund/stock sales (Schedule D) from their mainstream product (Deluxe). For those of us who make a couple of sales a year, dropping this very basic support is stunning and is a nothing more than a calculated, cynical decision on Intuit's part. Defending this move by stating that the functionality was removed from TurboTax on-line therefore it had to be removed from the desktop version so as not to confuse us, the customers, is just as ridiculous as it sounds."

I complained to Intuit and they agreed to provide a free upgrade this year. After many years using Turbo Tax I will purchase alternative software next year. Intuit's explanation that the additional cost is due to ""software upgrades"" is B.S, I suspect that Intuit made the change because their ""bottom line"" needed an upgrade. I hope that Intuit's ""bottom line"" incurs a significant downgrade because of its despicable conduct. In addition, Intuit was unable to download the State return with the free upgrade to Premier.

Though I considered other products, to save time, I got the Home and Business version of TurboTax, which I find looks a lot like the Deluxe version of last year, right down to the same oh-so-helpful photos of mostly(?) the same ""real tax experts"" and, it seems to me, almost the same dialog: only the upsell pages for ""Home and Business"" are missing this time this time, maybe because they already forced that upsell on the consumer.

Not only did they remove Schedule D from TurboTax Deluxe, it costs $10 (25%) MORE this year than it did last year on Amazon! Even if purchased the software on sale last year, the best that can be said is that Intuit removed core functionality of the product and kept the price the same. Said another way, if you want the same functionality as last year's Deluxe, you have to purchase Premier, which costs 20% more than this year's increased Deluxe cost! Terrible decision, and I don't appreciate their ""VP of TurboTax"" stating in comments that one can still complete Schedule D in forms mode -- not only is this no better than getting the form on the IRS site (for free), but it eliminates the ability to e-file. It appears that H&R Block's TaxCut Deluxe software kept Schedule D functionality, and costs less than TurboTax, to boot.

Needless to say I was not happy. I called Intuit and explained my situation. I am giving them two stars because the customer support rep gave me a free upgrade to TTax Home and Business. He did get me to agree that this was a one time deal and I would have to buy the full Home and Business for next year. I'm happy they did this for me. However I am not happy about what they did with their Deluxe product. I like the TTax product, but it looks like I may have to switch to H&R Block for next year (unless they do something funny with their product). Maybe Intuit will wise up and put the stuff back that they removed from the Deluxe version. Wishful thinking when greed is involved.

I purchased the boxed Deluxe version like I always do not realizing that features I need had been removed. Now I have to screw around with the online upgrade, pay the increase for the upgrade, and then apply for the rebate. And from here on out have to purchase the higher priced Premium version in future years. Price for the Deluxe version is $54.99 and $79.99 for the Premium version.

I've been exclusively desktop/CD based given the sensitivity of the financial information - and the cloud is out of my control. I've been using TurboTax Deluxe for years - and this year I have one (1) stock sale - and for lack of e-file on Schedule D, I'm forced to TurboTax Premier? The form may exist somewhere, but I can't e-file? C'mon... I've also potentially got one line on Sched C where my consulting deductions exceed $100. I'm forced for that one line to go up to TurboTax Home and Business or I can't e-file? Really? In the interest of transparency - what are the limitations for efiling with each version? Can they be spelled out somewhere? Not publicizing them is deceptive by omission - ""changes have been made"" does not cover it. Your vague ""call us and we'll help you decide"" offer is not transparent and does a disservice to the rest of us making an online purchase decision. Are you afraid that the version specific limitations will scare more customers away then these reviews? We're doing our own taxes - I think we can figure out what product we need if you give us the details what each version will allow for e-filing. It's nowhere on your website or in the product description. It needs to be explicitly stated ""Premier required for efiling Schedule D"". Not ""Premier is the best version for your situation"" - Sheesh... I can't take the chance that I'm buying crippled software, nor do I want to pay for features I'll never use. I don't mind paying for value - I'm using Quicken Home and Business - but will rethink that as well. The alternatives are out there. Intuit - you've lost me...

I went to Intuits website and every indications is that Turbo Tax 2014 will not automatically generate a Schedule D (Stock trading). It appears to allow for manual creation of a Schedule D form but you cannot eFile the manually generated form? The only question I still have is why they call it deluxe.

When I finally got a call-back, I was placed on hold and then lost in cyberspace as someone passed me down the line. So, now 2 days later, I haven't a confirmation number and I can't upgrade.

The only way I could use this 2014 version was on my 11"" Mac laptop -- not my choice of platform and not on the 21"" desktop machine where my past years' returns are. While an OS upgrade is ""free"", I'd have to buy added RAM and tweak or lose other apps to effectively run a system which would satisfy Intuit. I'm a ""forms"" method user of TT and found that, for the past two years TT was pushing me to create burdensome worksheets which the IRS did not need just to enter multiple, simple cash charitable contributions or simple stock transactions. Together with Intuit's 2014 gross misuse of the word, ""Deluxe"" as so many reviewers have pointed out, I have several reasons to have bought a competing product which: 1) runs on my 10.6.8 desktop; 2) easily imported my past TT return and 3) lives up to its version name, ""Deluxe"".

I don't need the schedules this year (it's a good thing because having to pay almost double the amount to file them is ridiculous!) but the principle behind the price gouge rubs me the wrong way. I was happy to find that H&R Block will give me a free Deluxe version of their product and it's getting good reviews so I'm no longer a TT gal! I have been a long time TT user (since 1997) and always enjoyed the ease of being able to import all of my previous years info, give it a couple of tweeks and be off and running. This long term relationship has come to an end. Even though I purchased the product, I won't be using it, I'll give it to my daughter or my son to enjoy this year and encourage them to use H&R Block next year . This year I'll be using H&R Block (free of charge of course) to see what they offer. All it took was a simple email sent to SwitchToBlock@hrblock.com with the info they asked for: Name, address, and phone number Type of operating system in use (Windows/Mac) A photo, scan, or email showing proof of TurboTax Basic or Deluxe purchase and I get a free download of their deluxe program. Here's hoping that the Block is much less greedy than Intuit and works hard to keep their customer base. Next year I'll need those schedules so keep me happy Block...happy customers are repeat customers. And Intuit, the smoke and mirror show you keep blowing because you think people won't see through it.....it's not working. Removing the schedules and charging more didn't make it easier for anyone but you. I didn't use the schedules last year (even though I bought the deluxe version) and all I had to do was skip those sections, I wasn't inconvenienced in the slightest. You purposefully left off the ""important"" changes from the cover of the package hoping that people would just purchase the product even though it had changed. If you flip the cover over, on the top of the product is a small (I mean small...like maybe 1/4"") orange strip with tiny words that say ""! New- Some features are now only available in these versions of TurboTax"" and then product descriptions listed below that. The fact that the Deluxe version only has 2 sections in the descriptions is what made me get online and start looking around and lead me to Amazon reviews...wish I would have done it BEFORE I had hubby bring it home."

This is an absolutely piss-poor way of doing business and a way you can let Intuit know you feel this way is to either not buy the software (duh) or leave a nice 1-star review.

Now, after months of trying to cover that up, their General Manager of the Turbo Tax division, Sasan Goodarzi, ""begins"" to confess. He admits that they ""messed up"". However, he lies and claims two things: 1) that Turbo Tax has not lost any market share because of their mess up. NOT TRUE. All you have to do is look at the more than 1,600 customers on Amazon that gave them a one-star rating. Many of US have already purchased H&R Block's tax software, and MANY of US will never go back to Turbo Tax. 2) that they had already decided to offer ""deep discounts"" BEFORE THE USER REVOLT. It is just plain pathetic that someone would make those two false claims publically. All you have to do is read the reviews going back for the past several months to see that those deep discounts were NOT being offered. Instead, they attempted to explain away their violation of customer trust and loyalty. I will pass on their ""deep discount"" because I have already completed my 2014 tax return with H&R BLOCK's software and found it just as user friendly and much cheaper. I will continue to be an H&R BLOCK customer, that is as long as they don't pull the same kind of dirty trick that Intuit did."

If you can wait a few days for that communication, I believe it will be best. If, however, you need to upgrade now please let me know and Iâll arrange for the upgrade."" I waited a couple of days and requested the upgrade. That was last evening. So far, I have not received it. I read an article regarding this situation today stating, (quoting VP Meighan speaking to Forbes), if you demand it, you get it, otherwise TT will only do what they have to. (I'm paraphrasing) I choose not to be a jerk. I'm one of those people that just quietly go away which also means there is a chance they are misreading my lack of being a jerk means I'm a pushover....their loss. Based on their online fix for the situation, it is calculated much like a typical rebate. Statistically people are lazy with following up on rebates and I'm sure that TurboTax knows that. TT could have easily charged $5.00 for the Premiere upgrade, but chose instead to charge $30. and then rebate $25. after filing only to those who filed their 2013 taxes on TurboTax. Although this marketing blunder only affects those who require specific schedules, other Deluxe users will never notice. Monetarily TT may come out just fine. If not, I suspect some heads will roll.

My dad used the program, I used the program, and it worked really well. I have no qualms with the interface of the software. This whole mess with the Deluxe version is just confusing. It sounds like I'd be okay with the software in regards to interest and dividends, as long as I didn't sell any stock or mutual funds. Then you have to buy the Premier version (for $80). So, am I going to have to bounce around between versions each year on the chance that I've sold a stock? Taxes are confusing as is, now this malarkey. No thanks.

Essentially you have to buy the Premier Version to get this fairly simple form which merely carries over the information from other forms which TT wants you to enter. Too cheesy for words. If they had just raised the price of Deluxe I would have been OK. Everyone needs to make money. But they're just being annoying by removing a form which you could fill out yourself and which wouldn't cost them anything to include. Bush league in the extreme.

Frankly I am not surprised that Intuit raised the price and lowered the features. Intuit is all about itself. They don't give two hoots about little businesses. I also subscribe to their enhanced payroll service, and that keeps going up in cost all the time too. I pay our employees on a weekly schedule because that frequency is what our employees need for their family budgets. (Singles, Single mom's, and young families) Intuit has started slamming me with extra fees for running each payroll and now is charging for direct deposit. They are a bunch of crumbs who roll over little businesses once they get their hooks in. Well, I am not going to take it any more. I am moving to H&R Block, AND I am going to take a second look at Zen Payroll Systems. To heck with Intuit and turbotax and any other products they have- I hope others will follow me. Good Bye !"

One such flack, VP Bob Meighan, has claimed in a response to a reviewer that ""most simple C filers receive a Form 1099-MISC that requires them to file Sch C even if it is for a one-off job or a temporary consulting job. For them, they really don't have expenses. That was the reason we provided the simple Sch C filing functionality in all TurboTax products from Deluxe up."" Well, I am one of the many filers posting here who *does* have expenses; I file Schedule Cs for independent contractor/freelance work for myself and for my wife. I warrant that's a fairly typical use of Schedule C in the Deluxe version of TT, and now Intuit expects me to pay an additional $30 charge that they've snuck in the back door for the sake of ""consistency?""

This will serve as my petition and public notice that I will NOT be using TurboTax for my tax filing this year, I'm not interested in ""discounts"", I'm not interested in public apologies. I'm not interested in waiting until next year to see what TurboTax will do about this problem. I'm guessing nothing except for discounts to soften the blow. The automatic, generic-looking responses from VP Bob is giving the consumers a message that this problem is widely known and massive by comparison. It also gives a hint of suggestion that they are not interested in responding to the key issues that have been brought forth. We want answers. Don't you think your long time loyal customers deserve that? I guess not. Just fix it then! And MAYBE you will get your customers back. That's if we don't fall in love with another product that is not only cost competitive but gives the loyal customers what they need: The missing schedules which have always been standard with deluxe AT A FAIR MARKET PRICE and the loyalty, consistency and security we as tax payers need! Someone commented ""didn't Netflix teach them anything?"". The difference is Netflix took immediate action and fixed it. I think Turbotax is waiting to see what the cause and effect will be to their customers by this action. They gambled with the idea that too many people have trusted TurboTax for many, many years and are too reluctant to change. They banked on human nature. But in this economy? When do the consumers say enough is enough? With capitalism comes freedom of choice. I choose to go elsewhere. Start a new beginning. I don't know what will happen next year but I don't want to wait to find out that I should have made the change THIS YEAR. I will make the change now. I believe they plan to keep it this way since most consumers are Deluxe users and they are hoping they will ""buy in"" and accept the fact that buying the premier version will be their only option with no questions asked. We are smarter than that."

What shabby disregard for longstanding customers--in my case since TurboTax first begun. Whether I use TurboTax again after this year's debacle will depend on whether Intuit can do substantially better than the beyond-lame, self-justifying statement that they thought was an apology. There was something deeply disturbing about the soul of a company and its leadership in the business ethics of this whole sordid affair, and that ""apology"" did nothing but underscore how disconnected Intuit apparently is from what most people expect as the bare minimum of honest and fair dealing. Tax time is unpleasant enough, especially having to contend with a tax code and bureaucracy that is severely broken. But getting poked in the eye and treated as an idiot by Intuit even before getting started really makes the whole experience particularly repugnant."

1313,R64ECZQQYRBU1,"Major feature downgrade = pay more for less","For 2014 Intuit downgraded the feature set while raising prices and keeping the TurboTax Deluxe (TTD) name. The lack of clear notice and openness about it seems very deceptive, and this longtime TTD user is appalled. People like me have used TTD for years with Schedules C, D, and/or E and been able to e-file. Not this year. You wonât find interview questions for these forms in TTD. You can enter Schedules C and D tax data manually or by import but then may otherwise not realize it until ready to e-file that you must choose to either upgrade to Premier or Home & Business or paper-file using Deluxe (and forgo Intuitâs audit guarantee). Yes there's a phone number to complain and request a free upgrade. But if you read carefully, you see that there is no blanket free-upgrade policy. The Intuit executive here has said the free upgrade decision is made on a ""case-by-case basis."" Some have reported getting right through and being given a code to upgrade with no hassle. Others posted here that they canât get their request handled properly. Some people here said that they were offered only a partial discount or no discount. In my opinion this mess has been handled abysmally by Intuit to date. BTW: Think any loyal TTD customer will get a free upgrade next year? My money says: Nope. Just say no to TurboTax Deluxe. H&R Block Deluxe (HRBD) is a better choice. I know it seems like a hassle to change tax software youâre used to, but 2014 HRBD has been hassle-free. Nearly all 2013 TTD customers import their 2013 tax return to 2014 HRBD with no problem, although it may not work well with WinXP. (See reviews and comments for HRBD.) 2014 HRBD feels like 2013 TTD to most customers who have used both. HRBD costs less than TTD anyway and is a much better value in terms of the e-file-supported feature set."
1314,R1IQJ566TQXDIZ,"Does not support Forms K-1; Product can't be returned through Amazon","Buyers should be aware that Deluxe also no longer handles all Form K-1s in its interview section. The program states that upgrade to Premier is required. (There was no mention of any ""forms only"" option.) I have no need of any sophisticated securities purchase and sale support or support for complex business accounting, but will apparently have to upgrade solely to get accurate input off of this one key tax form. UPDATE: I find TurboTax's response -- which is essentially that they have retained, but buried in the Forms mode, functionality for Form K-1 -- to be totally unpersuasive. If you're going to not support Form K-1 data for product symmetry reasons, then don't support it. If you are going to support Form K-1 data, then support it. You don't choose to eliminate maybe at most ten screens, but console customers by telling them if they are tax-savvy enough, they can still find a work-around by going to forms mode. (And I again reiterate, THE PROGRAM ITSELF DOES NOT TELL YOU THIS. When you try to enter a K-1 in the interview process (for which there seems to be an opportunity if you import last year's data), IT TELLS YOU ONLY THAT YOU MUST UPGRADE AND SPEND $30 MORE. No mention of the supposed forms-only workaround.) I requested a refund on 12/3 pursuant to Intuit's satisfaction guarantee. (Amazon directed me to this as the method for return; Amazon will not allow return of a downloaded product even if the description was misleading -- which also is a problem and a caution for any future purchases.) Still have not heard anything from Intuit about getting me my money back."

After reading some reviews on Amazon for HR Tax I was confident that it could import my 2014 TT without issues. The import went without a hitch and my simple tax return was filed without issue. Package was $24.95 + free federal and $19.95 for state filing.

Even when I try to open 2013 TurboTax, it asks for my password. I can't even get into 2013 to view or amend. 2014 TurboTax - where to begin with the problems. You can't even print forms that you want. Example: Schedule B if you are not required to file that form (less than $1500 in Int & Div) you can't even select to print it for your records. The new healthcare form 8965, it walks you through questions but if income is too low, you are told no penalties. It doesn't even ask for the Exemption Certificate Number that you need to file with your tax return. If you are not familiar with taxes, you could easily overlook necessary information because TurboTax doesn't require you to input the info. I've had frustration with every tax return I've done this year so far. Schedule D, C etc are not part of Deluxe version. You need Premier. But you can get free upgrade, except, info given by customer service is incorrect. I still have to figure out how to get my free upgrade. What a nightmare TurboTax has created. Whomever designed and authorized this end product needs to be fired. No excuse. The older versions of TurboTax 2010, 2009 etc were much better and easier to use. I didn't care for 2013 and 2014 is the worst. Edited: I got my free upgrade to Premier. In the Federal taxes - under Wages & Income - Investment Income 1099-B, Stocks, Mutual Funds etc - click Update. It will ask if you want to upgrade to Premier. click. Then it will say already paid for, click confirmation number. Call TurboTax number provided, they will ask for that Serial number and will give you a confirmation number free. Also, finally figured out how to print a form even if it's not required for filing. ie Schedule B in this case. Click Forms.

[...] It gives a phone number to call and says Intuit can upgrade your software for free if they want to. Also HR Block is allowing people to get their software for free if you purchased TurboTax this year. Intuit claims the reason they made the change was to make the desktop version the same as the the online version. The online version doesn't have all the options as the desktop version (Schedule D, C, etc) Well Intuit, you had a choice to make the online and desktop versions the same. You could have either added what was lacking to the online version to make it the same as the desktop version or you could remove the extra features of the desktop version to make it the same as the online version. We see which option you choose. You chose the option that screws the customers and makes you more money. Your excuse of trying to make the two versions the same doesn't fly. Why didn't you just add what was missing to the online version. If you were going to take away features from the desktop version why didn't you reduce the price. Also i'm not seeing where TurboTax attempted to warn people they were going to be ripped off this year. If you had of informed people you wouldn't have all these angry people that got ripped off this year. Shame on Intuit.

I get Intuit wanting to obtain more revenue but most businesses understand that they have to add capabilities and features that make the customer perceive he is getting more value for the higher priced item. Instead they are charging the same price as last year but are delivering a crippled product that can't do pretty basic tax functions like e-filing with a Schedule D or E. They are relying on their valued customers buying Deluxe again same as last year and only then finding out after they've opened the product and can't return it that they have to spend another $30 to get a product that actually works. This is outrageous from my point of view and you can only do this to me once. It is incomprehensibly stupid from Intuit's point of view.

I am still using Quicken 2005. Why? Because it works well, does what I need, and is not filled with pushed advertisements and bloatware like more recent Quicken releases. Vote with your wallet.

When I called Turbo to lodge my complaint, I was immediately offered a free copy of Home and Business and received an apology for not getting any advanced notice of the change. While I appreciate their efforts to appease me, do they really think that I will now be okay with having to spend $80 next year and the year after, etc. Turbo should have left their products alone.

I have very simple investment sales reporting needs and do not require help calculating capital gains/losses, etc (so do not require Premier version hand-holding). In the past being able to manually enter my info onto the Schedule D form that was included with the Deluxe version served my needs well, so I always stuck with TurboTax despite being more expensive than H&R Block.

Their arrogance at ignoring their customers complaints is exceeded only by their consummate greed. I notice the same issues with their other products like Quicken. I can only hope this most recent 'misstep' will be their undoing, and their entire culture of corporate greed will be irrevocably changed. Upper management should be replaced. I also found their Super Bowl XLIX commercial about the Boston Tea Party to be insulting to our national heritage. Another example of their complete disconnect with their customers and way off base.

You may have seen the Intuit president's apology on-line and his promise to try and regain the good relations Intuit had. Regretfully, Intuit is continuing its stumbling. The Intuit website has posted the president's offer to upgrade the Deluxe software to Home and Business - essentially that restores Deluxe to the level of functionality that it has always had. Since the president of Intuit has had to publicly apologize for this fiasco, you would think they would do anything they could to recover the customer's faith and allegiance. Instead they continue to damage credibility The offer made by the president to make things right only appears in small print at the bottom of the intro page, hidden under an asterisk as though it were a dull legal disclosure document instead of an important offer. If you sincerely wanted to fix this wouldn't you make the offer in large, flashing letters? I searched the website and could not find anything. I called and was told by a cold, mechanical voice that I would get called back. That hasn't happened. I figured, well, we have a savvy tax and software giant so certainly there would be something in the purchase process that would kick in so I went through the entire process until just short of buying and nothing showed up. Folks, you can stay with a company that is so transparently unconcerned with customer relationships - except in empty platitudes - but for the first time in decades my tax return will be done by H&R Block. UPDATE. Finally got a call back from Intuit and was pleasantly surprised, considering. The lady at the other end of the line quickly got the necessary information and promised a mailed CD to update my Deluxe software to Home and Business capability. Delivery in two days. No additional charge. I still feel that the Intuit management stepped all over their ... well, anyway, it was a dismal performance but the intent to repair is now appearing.

So helpful to not have to fill out all those pages by hand, not to mention trying to figure out what blanks to put all those numbers on. I joyfully hopped on the Turbo Tax bandwagon and urged friends and family to do the same. I was a happy camper, thrilled that if an error was discovered, I had only to correct that blank and all other blanks would be corrected (very helpful when we moved and my husband's company sent some needed 1099 forms I wasn't expecting after I'd done the taxes but before I filed them--no having to rewrite a bunch of forms by hand). I had noticed over the past several years that Turbo Tax had been dumbing down their questions, making it take longer to get through the forms because of longer, more detailed questions, but I continued to follow their directed questions to make sure I didn't miss anything. And maybe newbies to the product were helped by questions I considered to be redundant and on a very elementary level. A friend told me about H & R Block, but I was reluctant to leave a system that I was already happy with, even though it was cheaper. To summarize, since the new and improved Turbo Tax Deluxe will no longer serve the purpose for which I have bought it for 10 years, I will take the advice of the many reviewers and purchase H & R Block's software."

Even if I concede the points that the VP of TurboTax made (and I actually think he is probably a very good VP), the bottom line for me is TurboTax is now out of my price range. Why do I say that? Last year I was able to switch to the Standard Deduction for the first time, but I still had capital gains and losses. This year I only have one capital gains issue: the sale of a single stock. So in my case switching to TurboTax Premier would be like using a sledge hammer to kill a fly. So for me this will be a simple case of the public making a decision on price when I switch to a different tax solution. So I have changed from one to two stars, but I still don't buy products that have been rated at one or two stars by a large number of people.

Disappointed with 2014 changes in feature/functions and Intuit's lame response to customers (web site, phone, media/press). I have been using TurboTax products for about 25 years. Is it really worth the extra $20-30 bucks to lose a repeat customer over this? I suspect somebody in Intuit's Finance/Marketing Dept. ran a ""model"" and determined that ""x"" % of customers will flee to competitor products over this change. BUT -- 'net net' it is the RIGHT thing to do to improve revenue (think ""Ford Pinto"" gas tank design decision disaster!). I hope they change their minds and all FREE upgrades to Premium or Home/Business versions -- and get this silly mistake behind them. Coca Cola did it -- and saved their brand. You have choices... do the right thing! UPDATE: After receiving eMail from Intuit about $25 Rebate Offer today ( Jan 28, 2015 ) Here's a letter I sent to Sasan Goodarzi (General Manager, TurboTax Products) I am sorry -- this is just not enough to make this issue ""go away"" for me and many others... While this offer may help a little bit this year (2014 taxes)--- I still end up paying another $15 for Premium Version after the $25 Rebate! The bigger issue for me - and MANY other loyal TurboTax Customers - is that we are EXTREMELY UPSET about ""the change"" in feature/functions that have been part of TurboTax solutions for the past 25+ years (I have used the product since mid-1980's). The fact is --- this ""change"" impacts your customers ""going forward"" into 2016+. I am not prepared to pay an additional $40-60 per year for Premium or Home/Office versions than I paid in past years. I have already ""moved on"" to H&R Block 2014 Deluxe Version. You will NOT get my business back -- after I migrate my 2013 data into the H&R Block solution. The ""return switch-back to TurboTax"" is going to be a low probability in my case --- since I have psychology already ""moved on"" from Intuit products. The ONLY way I would be willing to give you my business is if you REVERSE YOUR DECISION and RETRACT ""the change"" in the ""Deluxe"" product. Restore the ""Deluxe"" features/functions into the 2016 product -- and make your 2014 customers as 100% whole for the 2014 Premium or Home/Office version mandatory upgrades.

Why does TurboTax require me to connect to the internet through their servers to print my return you might ask? I would love to know the reason for that too.

So, excuse me if i am just a little apprehensive about sharing information with TurboTax SERVERS just to print my return.

Changes have been made to the DELUXE version this year such that it is incapable of completing a simple return for a college student earning less than $10,000 per year. After appealing to Intuit's customer service without remedy my trust in the company has been broken. My daughter received a small scholarship from a trust, resulting in a 1041 K-1. This has been a regular occurrence for my children for many years, and in all prior years this was easily handled by the DELUXE edition. This year (2014 returns), reductions in functionality have been made to the program such that the PREMIER edition is required to complete this tiny aspect of her return (literally $219 of income). These changes were made, in my opinion, without adequate notice of the changes - a ""bait and switch."" All of this was discovered, of course, during a last-minute rush to complete the return, requiring an upgrade to the PREMIER edition from within the program at the retail price directly from Intuit. Intuit apparently did offer a partial rebate but that window expired before I found out about this problem. I appealed to Intuit customer service. The lady was agreeable but ultimately unable to offer any remedy. I hope it was worth the $30 upgrade to the PREMIER version that I was compelled to pay at the last minute, because I intend to do everything I can to make sure that was the last dollar Intuit ever receives from me.

I won't be calling anyone on the phone to finagle me a TT upgrade; I shouldn't have to. The BS explanation and pandering to get us ""valuable"" customers to call in and haggle for a discounted ""upgrade"" is an insult to our intelligence and to our loyalty.

You forgot to apprise us that we can download and complete Federal and state forms for free or instead go to our local tax preparer. There's plenty of time to push out an update that restores previous functionality, Intuit.

Update Feb '15: Ok, there were the disingenuous apologies from Meighan et. al. Once Intuit realized the breadth of their error, there were rebates and promises to do better next year. Now, there are reports that just to print/get hard copy, purchasers of the retail disc version must upload their returns to TT servers - one _cannot_ print without an internet connection. That defeats the privacy advantages of the disc version - unbelievable. Intuit, you've gone from very bad to worse. Every one I know, except one, has switched to HRB. Now it's my turn. Let's not even discuss the lameness of Quicken Essentials and Quicken 2015 (I personally know dissatisfied beta testers) vs. Q2007. Intuit, quo vadis? I can't go with you.

This should be more apparent on the box. I have now purchased a product I cannot use. Shame on you Intuit. I will be purchasing tax software from one of your competitors now for this tax year.

1445,RYT7TIPOHOX8G,"Customer support unresponsive","In addition to the removal of functionality from the Deluxe version, TurboTax customer support leaves a great deal to be desired. I've been trying to revolve a problem with the state download in TurboTax for four days, and calling their customer service number has been fruitless. Callers get a message stating ""we are experiencing high call volumes"" (really? You're not staffed to handle an influx of calls at tax time?) and an offer to have TurboTax call back. Unfortunately, the call isn't returned for two or three hours, so it's easy to miss - might as well be waiting for Comcast to fix my cable. In my opinion, Intuit has lost its customer focus, and I don't plan to be using TurboTax next year."
1446,R4SEV0PVH2MCE,"Agree with the 1 star reviews: Deluxe de-sope is an Intuit money maker","I've been using TurboTax for many many years and the need to pay $30 additional to get REAL Sched D support (not via manual forms) is truly a money making move by Intuit. If I had read the Amazon reviews before I bought the software, I would have switched to their competitor. Surprising enough, the comments on the Intuit site don't discuss this change to Deluxe. And what the Intuit VP wrote in previous posts is just plain poor public relations. If Deluxe 2015 doesn't go back to the previous 2013 capability, I will definitely be switching products next year. Next is to find an alternative to Quicken- they already force an upgrade upon you every few years whether you want improvements or not."
1447,R1AZDOQ1NP4GLM,"Stay Away From the 2014 TurboTax Deluxe","I have used the Deluxe version of TurboTax for well over ten years and have up until now always appreciated the ease of use and effectiveness. I'm sorry I did not read the earlier reviews before I jumped on the special deal for Prime members (that does make me wonder). As others have reported they are trying to force us into buying the Premier version for simple Schedule D, C and other functions that we have always been able to complete with the Deluxe version of the software. Called their help desk and never got a call back seems like intuit does not care about loyal customers, not a good business model. Avoid this purchase now and look at some of the other tax packages now available for a more reasonable price. I also plan on staying away from any future Quicken updates as well."
1448,R2EE2QHJ738IOG,"I'm done. Screw Turbo Tax.","Bought this after they said they'd let you do schedule C and D and it still forced me to pay 30 to upgrade to premier. I didn;t think that was a big deal because I'd get 25 off. No dice, since I didn't use deluxe last year I don't qualify.... I'm done with turbo tax this is ridiculous. I've used them since 1997. Just terrible."
1449,RLICBQZCSFABD,"Never again","This was the last straw for me using Turbbotax software. My taxes are pretty straight forward and easy to compile and complete and TurboTax is good for that. However, this year when I tried to e-file my State taxes, I was unable to opt for the credit card payment because their payment system doesn't work. I called customer service three times and had to go through their hateful phone queue each time. On all three calls, the customer service rep disconnected me - every time. Now, one of the things they ask you for in customer service is your phone number to verify your account, so I know they had my number. Did anyone bother to call me back? No, of course not. So instead of it costing $19.99 to e-file my state, the only option left is the $39.95 to e-file with TurboTax taking the money out of my federal refund. As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing but a scam. You either pay them an extra $20 or they simply sit on your return. No more TurboTax for me - they an join AT&T as a banned company in my household."

A anticipate that doing so will make leaving Intuit a pleasure, that may stick on me. Adding to the major issues that most of us have, I am also a swing option trader. As far as I know, TurboTax still does not provide any way to automate option trading data into any of its software cost levels. Regrets, and wishes for a satisfactory tax filing to all."

In fact, I used it for my 2013 taxes for the 1st time in a long time. Why? Because I sold a few shares in a mutual fund. Other than that, I have no need for schedule D. And I certainly don't need the hand-holding to fill it out. Sell 1 mutual fund? What's the big deal? But if I have to pay up more $ for that, then I must look elsewhere for my income tax support. Why? Because if I sell a few shares of a mutual fund, the extra $30 (or whatever) for the ""privilege"" of filling out schedule D will wipe out much of my profit, if any, never mind the tax man's vigorish! Add to that the nagging in Quicken 2014: The new version is out, buy it now! I uncheck the ""remind me later"" box, but every now and then it reminds me later! I've been happy with Quicken and TurboTax, until now. I'm sorry it's come to this. I'm forced to look into alternatives for both."

Because I had not opened the product yet, I thought, what the heck is he apologizing for? Then I come to find out that my tried and true TurboTax Deluxe will not function as it did in the past, and I for one, need all of the forms that they have eliminated. Well TurboTax, I would have never even thought of using any other tax software, but with this type of underhanded business practice, I have returned my yet unopened TurboTax Deluxe and purchased the H&R Block Deluxe - after all, what do I have to lose? I want you to know that you have lost another long-time, loyal customer to the competition. Also, I hope that the TuboTax team measures their failure in the number of programs returned and the dollars associated with these returns. This blunder is as bad as ""New"" Coke (1985)."

But, forcing me to upgrade sounds like they are just trying to make a quick buck without any regard for their customer base or reputation. Yesterday I received an e-mail from an Intuit exec apologizing for ""messing up"". However, instead of acknowledging the mistake in deciding to drop the schedules from the ""Deluxe"" version, Mr. Goodarzi (his career has limited potential now) blames the negative acceptance by the customer base on poor communication and introduction of the changes to the product line.

I wouldn't have bothered to submit a review, but for the press coverage of their giving consumers a black eye (good job, marketing department!!). But I purchased and filed an online return in 2013 using Deluxe and I purchased and filed using Premier last year. And even though I filed through Quicken itself, so they have my complete records, their online refund 'helper' denies that I qualify. Which means I will have to waste an hour or two of my time finding my licenses and whatever other crap they'll demand and spending 30, 60, 120? minutes online with customer support as they presumably will keep stonewalling me for the promised refund.

Aside from the hidden price gouge, they have added undue complexity to the buying decision (which version do I really need?) I will move to a different product for next year.

For the cost to them of essentially nothing, they lose a customer of at least 20 years. Hell of a marketing team."

This year TurboTax wants to bump me to a higher tier product--with an associated 50% price increase. They removed support for Schedule E (along with Schedules C & D) from Deluxe and want me to use the more expensive Premier. Well, I'm not playing. Fortunately, I found out about the change before I made my purchase this year. I'll gladly give up the automatic transfer of my prior tax returns and do a little more typing in a new product. I might not find anything that much cheaper than Turbo Tax Premier, but that's okay as long as I find a company that wants my business enough not to try and gouge me. ***Update: Looks like the H&R Block software that includes Schedule E retails for $64.95. That's about $5 more than the price of TurboTax Deluxe. You know what Intuit? I would have stayed if you raised the price of Deluxe $5 but retained the functionality I needed. But this $30 forced bump to a higher tier? That's just insulting."

I'm very disappointed to learn that they have stripped the most important tool out of Deluxe - downloading investment data - ""to be consistent with the online version""? What do they take us for - fools? Why not make the online version like the desktop version? Likely, it will be just a matter of time before the other tax preparation software companies follow suit. Accounting firms might have weighed in on this, since they also purchase and use the software. It could be that accounting firms lobbied to strip the Schedule D out of Deluxe so that it was no longer affordable, and would drive some individuals to use them instead. I'm not familiar with other tax software - but guess I will have to learn a new one, and go through the trouble of filling out all of the information that previously was transferred automatically. I wonder if H&R will transfer my Turbo Tax data? I guess I will find out. No more Turbo Tax for me!!! :("

Wow, such overwhelming anger from loyal customers (of which I was one), and justifiably so. I find it difficult to believe that only 20% of TT customers use the missing schedules (especially Capital Gains and Losses). This could mean one of two things: either the 80% is low-income or high income, because these are the folks who do not or cannot have investments. I doubt high net-worth individuals will use TT over an advisor or specialist. Then if the customers are mainly low-income, then Intuit is facing price competition and margin erosion due to the increasingly tax code revisions - meaning more investment required to coding without the ability to raise prices on products due to low transition costs to alternatives (such as H&R Block). GM & VP should be ashamed. Thank you CEO Brad D. Smith, for helping your shareholders and boosting your own bonus."

Despite it's very low review ratings since inception of the app (1 1/2 stars in iTunes due to messing up the desktop files after syncing, not being able to split transactions and tag each of them individually is another example) there has been nothing done to correct these issues despite several people providing you feedback for 2 years!!!

1521,R2O5384Q0D83G0,"Quality product, but a greedy company who wants to extort you every chance they can","We have something in common. We all paid a premium price to TT, only to be extorted by TT to forceably upgrade our purchase to do common tasks that were previously included in the Deluxe version of TT in the past. For shame. This year, I had a K-1 filing. Simple form that was included in years past. Unless I spend another $30 plus state sales tax to upgrade to Premier , TT Deluxe would not take process my K-1. The form was not even listed in the forms section of the program. Quicken went down that path with forced upgrades to keep on-line updates of banking and credit card transactions. The program is good for 3 years and then ""poof"" this feature is shut off overnight. I'm still fuming over that one and I am working on an alternative now. I have two years to find it and I will do just that. Very disappointed with TT and Quicken products right now. Like many others here, I will be using H&R Block next year and into the future. Intuit, you have dug into my pocket for the very last time. Good bye and I hope sales plunge next year to a point you see the error of your greedy ways! ***** 2014-01-09 - Update Pandora's box has been flung open and the goblins are now out with NO hope of putting them back in without direct damage to Intuit and their reputation. Yes, I too received one of the condescending responses from Intuit today. There was absolutely no sincerity in their response to my review and adding insult to injury, the tone of their response was dubious in their sincerity to make things right for the end customer. Right now, Intuit is in full damage control mode. Reading back over the last 700 comments tonight, ""Bob's"" comments went from 1) you shouldn't expect what you got in years past and read the fine print on the box, to 2) we have made changes to align our product lines both on-line and on home computers uniformly to finally, 3) change can be challenging. These statements only threw gasoline on the fire in an attempt to put this PR blunder fire out. Intuit working these forums as hard as they are right now makes me think that Intuit is really seeing the mess they made. They are trying to see how they can dig themselves out of this and try to save face at the same time. From my vantage point, Intuit is not doing a very good job right now. How much worse is it going to get before Intuit takes some drastic action that should have been done at the outset of this problem? As one other reviewer put is so eloquently describing the current state of things (I'm paraphrasing) -- This blunder will be taught as a Marketing 101 case study in Business Schools. This mess has taken on a life of its own. I, for one, am interested to see what will happen at the end of this disaster. Stay tuned for more interesting developments. ****** 2015-01-23 - Update Finally, Intuit admits to their stupid mistake. They are now offering a $25 ""rebate"" for people who were forced to pay for the upgrade. First, I paid $30 plus 8.1% state sales tax, so I am not made whole. I'm still out of pocket $7(+) even with the rebate Second - a rebate that you have to jump through hoops to get, many many months from now. There are too many weasel ways out of this and Intuit will do just that. Lastly - to process the rebate, the very first question, out of the box - Intuit wants your Social Security number. What??!! I'll be dipsticked to give Intuit this most precious of precious numbers after this major screw up. Who knows where it will end up with these clowns. I didn't have to give my SS# to buy TT Deluxe, I didn't have to give my SS# to purchase my extorted copy of ""Premier"", I never gave a SS# on any Intuit product rebalte in the past, what makes you ,think I will do it now. Like I said before - POUND SAND Intuit!"

One year, it was having an HSA. I could have filed with TurboTax Basic except for needing a single form (8889) causing me to need Deluxe instead. The next year, it's a single stock sale causing me to need Premier instead of Deluxe. Is this by design? I think intuit needs a better business model. Perhaps allowing you to buy single form add-ons for $1-2 each, instead of one form being a $20-40 upgrade to the next TT tier. Or just having only two versions of TurboTax: Home (includes ALL non-business forms), and Business (includes everything else). Hopefully next year's TurboTax releases have a better strategy.

1526,R18XV9BEZN3M71,"The three mistakes of Intuit pricing.","As other posts indicate, Intuit is being deceptive in sales and marketing by not clearly forewarning loyal customers about the changes in their software. I have been using the product since inception. Initially, one product did it all. Then they started segmenting the capabilities. But as recently as last year, the Deluxe Federal (no State) with 5 e-files was available as I recall on disc from Best Buy and others for $29.95. And you could do all federal filings. The Premier version only added ""extra guidance and help"" but that one package was complete federal filing for 5 returns. The even cheaper Basic version would also do all returns bud did not have the deduction ""maximizer"" features of Deluxe, and as I recall you could get it for $19.95 (although hard to find). These prices are retail outlet prices not Turbo Tax Intuit prices. Now to file my return I would need the Home and Business version, Intuit disc price $109.99 for $99.99 on sale. (Same price at Best Buy today). So my tax prep cost has more than tripled from $29.95 last year to $99.99 this year. I am calling the 800-445-1875 number tomorrow to inquire as any other options, which I expect to be none, and then I will be looking elsewhere for my tax prep software. Don't understand any logic that would make this good business for Intuit. First, essentially tripling the price. Secondly, doing it in a sneaky way. Third, playing politics with their comments that they have not raised prices in years and blowing smoke. It's like they have taken advice from the Obamacare Gruber consultant and assumed their customers are stupid. There is no way this move will do anything but hurt them by ticking off longtime customers. Reviews indicate there are other good well priced tax packages out there and Intuit customers will be angrily flocking to them. HAPPY UPDATE: Thanks to another review pasted below, Intuit also upgraded my Turbo Tax this year after calling 800-445-1875 and speaking with a customer service rep. Apparently the entire program is on the disk and if you need a feature that is not available, you have the opportunity to pay and upgrade when you need the form. The rep will give me an unlock code to enter when I have the program installed on my PC. As Janet says below, hopefully they will change the 2015 product back to like the 2013 product!!! (Are you listening Intuit?) Many Thanks to a review by Janet McLaughlin ""I agree the 2014 Deluxe is not the same as previous years. However, I read Bob's suggestion to call 800-445-1875 (8am - 8pm EST M-F). I explained my tax return needs to the nice woman and she upgraded me for free. Hopefully TurboTax will change their product features back into Deluxe for next year, but for this year I can confirm that TurboTax is not being a Grinch!"" So all you users out there, buy the Deluxe and call 800-445-1875!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AFTER RESPONSE from Intuit Rep, my response was: Overall satisfied for this year, but next year will probably change horses. And as for the comparing Deluxe no state to Premier etc not apples to apples I agree. With the caveat that last year I did my C D E A schedules no problem with Deluxe for $30 and this year it would be at least Premier at $90 that I need (Best Buy), thus the triple the cost for my situation.

Iâve used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Iâve had to purchase much more expensive âeditionsâ of the product to handle all the forms, and Iâve generally paid extra for the âaudit defenseâ guarantee. This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product. First, in some situations Intuit wonât let you retrieve and print prior yearsâ returns unless youâve paid for the current yearâs product. I canât remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is donât just save your tax return in Intuitâs file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records. The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldnât file because a particular form wasnât ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark âDO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINALâ even though itâs supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return. Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems. Between that and the limited access to your own information that magically becomes no problem if you simply give them more money, Iâm very dissatisfied."

After countless years as a loyal TurboTax Deluxe customer, I will be switching to another product. I have a single investment account with Merrill Lynch that consisted over the years of various mutual funds. The consolidated year-end tax statement from ML made entering the tax information into TT Deluxe a no-brainer. In recent years, the imports were done via electronic download. There was never any need for the extra assistance offered in Premier, although each year I was urged to buy the more expensive product during the tax preparation and filing process. To think that I would have to upgrade and pay extra just to e-file is preposterous. Goodbye TurboTax."

Where on any of the product documentation is it highlighted that features and functions have been removed from the Deluxe version? Intuit needs to admit their mistake and simply restore what they removed via an online update, automatically, free of charge. Requiring customers to call and complain to get upgraded to Premiere is ridiculous. Note to Intuit: Better increase the staffing in your call center. I have also used Quicken for longer than TurboTax and I am tired of the continual every three year forced upgrades on that product. I am leaving Intuit as their business model is to bilk more and more money out of it's customers instead of offering best of breed software that consumers rave about. Well the consumers are raving now. Congratulations Intuit. No more feeding the Intuit pig. If there was a negative 5 stars rating option I would have picked that."

I have also read Intuit's response about allowing present Deluxe users a free upgrade within the program, starting February 7th. Can they not immediately allow users with genuine Deluxe copies a free upgrade to the Premier version without charging the $30 upgrade fee. Not impressed with the proposed corrective measures and lack of responsiveness by the company."

Now you can be sure I will change to a competitor next year. And to add insult to injury they offer you a $25 refund for a product upgrade that costs $30 more on their own website. If they wanted to do it right they should have given all their 2014 Deluxe customers the Premier edition upgrade at no additional cost for misleading them and give them a discount on the 2015 edition next year to insure they stay with TurboTax. But that would be the honorable thing to do and we know that corporate America does what is right for them, not the consumer."

Hey, if we all treated clients like that, then we wouldn't need a schedule C, because we would be out of business. Getting ready to install H&R software, so far they seem to appreciate my kind.

I dont know if it will this year or not, and herein lies the problem. I have a judgement call to make. I can either purchase TurboTax deluxe and, given the changes to the product, hope that all of my needs are met. Or, I can purchase a different product based on all of the reviews and comments about this and other products. I've used TurboTax pretty loyally for over the past decade. Ive not only done my taxes, both both my parents as well as my in-laws. TurboTax Deluxe has always met our needs. Will it this year given the changes? I have no idea. I havent decided what tax prep software I am going to use. Given the reactions to this change, I may purchase this and, if it doesnt meet my needs, use one of the options for the ""right"" software.

What I do fault them for is (1) the size of the effective price increase (double, seriously?) with no improved value proposition (2) that they believe weâre too dumb or too wealthy to care, and (3) for lying to our faces about why it was done. The VP repeatedly states on here it was not a money grab but was a âdifficult decision done to align the products.â Well, the online Deluxe version had been aligned with the Deluxe packaged version every year until last year, when the Sched D was first removed from the online Deluxe product. I know this because I was a longtime user who was an unlucky discoverer of the schedules quietly being removed last year after many hours invested in my online Deluxe return. So the products were deliberately misaligned by TT last year, and now they are claiming that Sched D must be removed from the packaged version âfor the sake of alignmentâ. Well, that explanation is disingenuous at best, and dishonest at worst. Like others, I donât like the arrogance and lies coming from Intuit and will be voting with my wallet this year over to a competing product."

Just starting out, I'm pretty sure this will be the last year. The offline update process is extraordinarily painful: just try & find where you go to download updates. (I will not connect my tax machine to the internet -- also if I need to reconstitute my install, I want to have the update executables handy - data & updates are burned to a data CD). Product registration is overbearing and beyond annoying. This alone would drive me away. Additionally, the software no longer starts up with the tax form when you click on the tax form you want to use -- it starts in initial start mode, including doing a product update (even though it was disabled in the Online->Update menu). And think that I haven't even started the actual tax form yet. Perhaps I'm overly picky because I'm a software engineer, but I can see what Intuit is doing, how they are encouraging the ""desirable"" behavior.

Being one of those affected by the change, I decided to take the opportunity to try a different solution. I chose H&R Block Deluxe. After completing the 2014 filings for myself, and my extended family (6 returns), I have found H&R Block Deluxe to be as easy to use, and as accurate as TurboTax. The returns included home sales, investment sales and exchanges, IRAâs and capital loss/gain calculations. I was able to import prior year TurboTax files without issue, import investments from Ameriprise just as easy as TT, and even though the interface is different than TT, it was intuitive, and just as easy to use. My only minor complaints are that the pre-defined list of items in the donation calculator DeductionPro product in H&R Block is not as comprehensive as the ItsDeductible product in TT, and the state product did not contain the calculation of tax penalty, you had to download a form and calculate yourself, or request the state to calculate for you. Based on my experience this year, I will continue to use H&R Block Deluxe moving forward, unless they make a bonehead move like Intuit did this year with TurboTax. Thank you Intuit for giving me the incentive to try another product and find that it works just as well, for less money. Your back peddling and empty apologies are not enough to win back my business. I have found that your product is not superior, and your business practices and care for your customer are offensive."

I needed access to Schedule C, like almost everyone else that has complained, which is no longer available in this year's version. The automatic free upgrade to Premier that was supposed to be available after February 7th still has not happened for me (I purchased the download for Mac on February 7th specifically for this issue). I just was on hold for 2 hours and 20 minutes waiting to speak to someone: when I finally came off hold, it rang twice and then disconnected my call. Really? As long as TurboTax resolves this problem in next year's version, I will probably continue to use it because I like the interface and it's way cheaper than a CPA. It's just a shame that they really dropped the ball this year, both in product quality and customer service. Good luck to everyone else out there that's trying to get a live person to help them from TurboTax. I'll update this to share any advice I get, if I ever get a call back or any satisfactory outcome.

I would suggest that everyone drop Amazon an e-mail asking for a refund of their purchase and request TaxAct or H&R Block instead as it seems that there's no visible way to get a refund for TurboTax once it has been purchased.

First I wasn't going to use TurboTax after they removed the extra schedule forms from Deluxe, and made you pay an extra $25 for them. However, after they realized they had a PR nightmare, they agreed offer it again for free. So, after purchasing the software, and doing my return, I found there was an error with an amount it imported from my 2013 return on my federal carry over form (not with my numbers I entered). Contacted support and used the call me back option. Well, the return call took a half a day. Then, the support person that called me wasted my time, because after about 20 minutes and sending her my tax file via TurboTax software, she determined she needed to transfer me to tax support, instead of product support (or something). So after she transferred me, I was on hold for another 2 hours before I hung up. This is horrible customer service. I have spent the better part of a day waiting on them to either call or while I was on hold. I won't be using TT again. I will be switching to HR Block!!!!"

Now, I find this REALLY irritating! I have been a loyal customer for a freaking decade and I get NO price break?!? This is a huge slap in the face. OH, and it gets even BETTER when you download the software from Amazon. It seems the description of the product fails to tell you that if you want to eFile your State return, you have to pay $19.99 more. Yeah, that's right! Also, THIS DOES NOT ""PLUG"" into your current online account if you have one and this product claimed to be trying to ""locate"" my previous years return on my laptop, but it couldn't locate it even though I was looking at it on my C drive. I had to MANUALLY input the information from my previous return. What I want to know is WHY is it that you want to SCREW your loyal customers as well as potential customers?

This year I purchased TurboTax Deluxe as I usually do only to discover days later that Intuit de-featured the software (no support for stock transactions or self employed income), which I have been using for years. Intuit did not transparently/openly disclose these to customers. Intuit held me hostage after having purchased the software and require additional money for an upgrade to the most expensive product. I called Intuit customer service to request a refund. They told me they would send an email with instructions, it did not happen. I call all of these being deceitful. Intuit, you lost my trust and lost me as a customer ..I am never going back... compound this for the number of years that I have left paying taxes and the other Intuit products I would have purchased. Intuit CEO and Board of Directors, if you happen to care about your customers and you see this, rest assured that shady moves like this one will be negative to your profits. End of the story.

Oh the nontaxable portion of my 401K, gee you hope I kept a record, since you don't have any information you can supply. But t was there when I did my 2013 return. Who knew how much detailed information and carryover could be lost in going from one year to the next. Oh, that's right we pulled a lot of stuff from the ""old"" deluxe package, so there's no way we could simply carry over everything from last year. You might of had forms from last year, that we don't support in this years version, so we'll just have to drop last years detailed information and have you reenter it.

The product prompts me to upgrade to the ""Home & Business"" version for $40. I felt as if I had been screwed, but I had no choice because I needed the forms, so I paid the $40 plus $2.40 sales tax. Then I discover that I am eligible for an eventual $25 refund (not the full $42.40 I paid) only after I file my taxes. Then, a couple days later, I learn in the press that TurboTax has unlocked the missing forms for everybody for free. Good news? No, not quite. If you hadn't already been coerced into paying for the upgrade, you get it free. But in my case, I had already paid $42.40 for an upgrade that I no longer needed. So, I called TurboTax customer service and politely requested a refund. I was told ""sorry, you are only eligible for the (delayed) $25 refund, but not the full cost you paid for the unneeded upgrade."" This is complete nonsense of course. They should have simply processed a credit card refund for $42.40 and moved on. Frankly, the $17.40 difference that I forfeited in this exercise is not important, but it is the principle that matters most. These people still haven't straightened out their act and I am reluctant to recommend this product for that reason alone."

I will also say, it's a decent dea for $40, but when you keep tagging on extra money for an additional state, and additional money for e-file, it doesn't become worth it for $120, when my accountant can do it right with zero effort for $100.

All seemed good and when I got back to e-filing - the paperwork showed that all I was going to pay was the $19.99 to e-file my state return. Apparently, TurboTax does not do a thorough job of testing it's software - I got my federal refund by direct deposit and low and behold, I had been charged the $34.99 fee for direct deposit.

I've used TurboTax for a million years and never wanted to change. I read the extremely helpful reviews published by Amazon readers, and wrote to H & R Block according to the instructions in the Forbes article. About 24 hours later (on Sunday), I heard from H&R Block telling me they would soon be emailing me a download instruction. I heard from them today (2 days wait, pretty darn good), followed their instructions, and downloaded the file. Good for one free state, and 5 free Fed filings. Easy process, easy download, easy import of my TurboTax files. Obviously they are under the microscope now. But so far H&R Block has performed admirably, in my estimation. They will have a customer for life if they keep up this good customer service. And I'll bet anyone dollars to donuts that their Deluxe edition next year WILL contain Schedule D!"
1655,R1I7KBT3OLR1GI,"Going over to the other side","Like many other commenters I have used TT Deluxe for many years and this year wasn't going to be any different until now. I think the folks at Intuit have put huge smiles on the faces of the H&R folks (way to go Intuit on making people happy). Switching to a different tax software package isn't done lightly and usually people like me stay with the same package year after year until something forces them to switch. That time has come for me to switch to H&R Block and most likely I will be satisfied with their package (functionality, useability and cost). Maybe many years from now I will be complaining about H&R Block but until that time Intuit (or some other company) won't get my tax software business. IMHO I believe Intuit is going to lose significant market share over this. Thanks to all who have reviewed and commented."

I suppose on some planet that makes more sense than adding features to the platforms that have shortcomings and maybe charging a bit more for those added options. I do find the Intuit reps groveling amusing though. ""PLEASE call us and we'll help you get what you thought you were paying for!"" - No mention of how much that help will cost, right? Bleh.

I've used this version for quite some time, and it's been useful. I discovered that Intuit has changed the software for this year, eliminating the ability to handle any stock sale. I have a few stock holdings, and sometimes a fractional share is sold, triggering the need for a Schedule D form. I see that I will have to upgrade to Premier ($30. extra!!) if I want to continue with Intuit. I DON'T!

There was no reason to do this except to force people to pay more for their software. This change was not communicated to customers. I believe that they are relying on people not realizing that there are features deleted until close to the filing deadline, and then are forced into paying for the upgrade rather than starting again with another product.

I have been a loyal TurboTax user since 2000 (at least), but the price point for Premier is not that far off from having my taxes done by a local CPA.

1678,R3C91NGFMMIKQR,"Big issue with online version users not getting refund (see Update)","I have been a loyal user of Turbo Tax for over 20 years, and an online user since 2008. That loyalty has most likely stopped as of today for the following reason: While preparing my taxes as usual in Turbo Tax online, I was surprised and shocked when after about halfway through entering my information I was forced to upgrade from the Deluxe version to Premier (due to preparing a Royalty entry for Schedule E, I assume). In researching the problem, I found out that Intuit/Turbo Tax people decided to arbitrarily and without notice to their customers/consumers not only increase the price of the product, but also that they removed several items normally used in the Deluxe version (specifically Schedule C, D, and E). I also saw that they offered â as compensation for their actions â a $25 cash back offer (refund) to customers who used a previous yearâs Deluxe product (2013) and this year (2014) had to upgrade to Premier. Seeing that, although I was still upset at the âsurpriseâ upgrade, knowing Iâd get a $25 refund from Turbo Tax I decided to continue on and finish my tax preparation online and e-filing. Imagine my surprise then when I tried to take advantage of their âmea culpaâ offer (*after* I paid and completed my e-filingâ¦ they said you have to use the upgraded version, used a 2013 Deluxe version previously, and have filed your taxes before you could apply for the $25 refund â all of which I had done), only to find out that the $25 refund they offered does NOT apply to online users!! So my question, rightly so, is: Why not? Why are we (online users) being punished for using the product online? It still was a âbait and switchâ, and was totally unexpected and without reason (other than the company admitting their error, I found out later), and ALL users were affectedâ¦ not only the CD or download users. Why then does Intuit/Turbo Tax feel their online users should not receive the same monetary savings/rewards/compensation that others do? Online users have suffered the same issues â being forced to upgrade â that the CD/Download users are. Had I known I was going to be forced to upgrade â and then they weren't going to honor online users the $25 refund â I would most certainly have gone elsewhere. It cost me an additional $16 to upgrade, the extra cost for the added difference in sales tax, plus the extra time, effort and energy for me to research on what happened. Additionally, the number they have listed to call to inquire about this issue is a waste of time â you donât even get to speak with anyone! You get an automated recording telling you to leave you phone number and theyâll call you back. You donât even get an option to hold! I'm very angryâ¦ on several levels. Not providing the same compensation for ALL their customers is not acceptable, and is blatantly discriminatory. Because I feel so strongly about this, I intend on warning everyone I can in every venue possible. I will NOT be using Turbo Tax ever again. Not providing the same compensation for ALL their customers is not acceptable and is blatantly discriminatory. UPDATE 3-13-15: When I was finally able to contact TurboTax (ironically, the only venue that contacted me back was via Facebook!), after stating what happened, I was given a refund. So while I was upset about the issue overall, at least TurboTax does listen to at least some of their customers. I appreciated this a lot, and because of that, I will reconsider using TT again in the future - especially also because they stated they plan on putting back the forms they took out of the Deluxe version this year and making it the way it was in prior years (such as Schedule C, D, and E). If they do put back those forms in next years version as they say, I'm sure I will be a return customer. And I have also changed my original 1 star to a 3 star because of this. I didn't give them 5 stars because of the problem (they should not have done this to begin with) and because they are sooo difficult to get in touch with (the toll-free number is useless... and they never did call me back even though I left several messages on their automated phone system)."

That was a showstopper for me, so I switched to another product for a year, then switched back after Intuit wisely dropped this 'feature'. But it looks like the lesson wasn't learned, and I see that the features I need to do my taxes have been crippled in the Deluxe Version which I've always used.

I followed you to Intuit. I (blissfully) ignored your privacy attacks on my computer back in '03 when you installed DRM on my computer without asking. I sat back and watched as you lobbied state legislatures to shut down effective and state-operated FREE filing programs, for no reason other than to be able to gouge us again--your loyal customers. But now your arrogance wins--you have pushed me away. Oh sure, you made a huge gaffe by underestimating how angry your customers would be when you gouged us again. Sadly, I expect that from you. But that's not the big deal. The big deal is how you responded to the problem. It wasn't your mealy-mouthed, disingenuous set of apologies and re-apologies. Again, I expect that from you. Instead, it was your CONTINUED arrogance and complete disregard for your customers. At the exact moment that you should have been straightening up and flying right--when you should have been on your best behavior--you just couldn't help yourself! 1) Instead of just giving everyone the product that you should have, from the start, you decide to set it up as some kind of special refund system. And you suddenly require me to cough up my social security number to you??? As though in this day and age of identity theft you think that handing out my social security number is *nothing*??? Obviously, to *you* it's nothing. Because it's MY identity. How can you be this tone deaf on the issue of security. 2) Instead of just giving everyone the product that you should have, from the start, you set up a special telephone hotline which is authorized to give people refunds or upgrades, but only if they complain loudly enough! Really? You're going to make some of your customers whole, but not all of them. Because why? Because if you can still gouge *some* of us, then that's what you're truly committed to doing. What an insult! 3) Walk with me down this tree-shaded web site. Intuit. Turbotax. Do you see anything on there about getting the product that you should have given us from the start? No. Your whole pretend apology is communicated only via email, and on LinkedIn, and who knows where else. Once again, the customer who comes to your web site wanting to buy the correct product ... nope, they're gonna get gouged. Because your apology is hollow and you truly, *truly* don't mean a word of it. Your business model is to gouge us. That's what you're about. Every page on your web site hides how to get the correct product for what I need. You could not be more clear. Thank you. 4) HOW CAN I FIND OUT how to buy the product that I need? There is no-place that I can find where you clearly state a policy for selling me the actual product that I need. You continue to play hide-the-puck. As though it's a cute game. Forty apologies later, and the rules keep changing. What are the current rules? Anyone? Anyone? (Bueller, Bueller?) That's it, I'm done with you. 5) Your cut-and-paste replies to Amazon negative reviews demonstrate in no uncertain terms that you really, truly, just don't care. You don't have the time to actually answer people's complaints. You issued an apology, or ten, and that should be good enough for us *customers*. I can hear your voice curl when you say the word.

This company literally sells nothing more than what amount to updates to its software year after year for full software prices, and then nickel and dimes customers for every single additional feature like additional states, e-file, etc. Now they are pulling something like this to bilk even more money out of long time customers. I will not be using TT again...ever...even if they put the Deluxe version back to what it was next year. Sorry Intuit, I live on principle not to support larger CEO bonuses. It's obvious that you've lost any balance between corporate greed and providing a good, quality product. Bye! **UPDATE : My favorite part of this whole debacle is the excuse the VP is using to justify Inuit's actions of crippling the Deluxe version. Paraphrase, ""We want to ensure a long running inconsistency between our standalone version and our online version was finally resolved to ensure fairness for the customers of both versions"". I get it, you wanted to make sure standalone copies of the software had the same features as the online version. The only problem is... THE STANDALONE VERSION WITH ALL FEATURES WAS FIRST! You people at Intuit created the inconsistencies by not providing the same features with the software when you built the online version later.

1758,RTN7A2QP43E7J,"Charging extra for different forms???","It is interesting what others are saying about this years version of turbo tax. I have used turbo tax, like many here, for about 20 years and have had those times, most noticeably in the early years, where there were problems with the software and updates. I have also struggled with Intuit's support of software - during the migration from 1999 - 2000 for Quickbooks for Macintosh. Because of Intuit's lack of support for Quickbooks on the Mac (Intuit was not supporting all of the software and directed using another brand software for different features - a company that I just moved from because of the problems I had with this other company's software), I had to purchase PC's to continue the use of Quickbooks. In the past I had used TurboTax's competitor - again many many years ago - but it sounds like I will be checking out the competitors again after reading these other reviews. In this day and age, taxes cannot be done without using software, but to charge additional money to get certain forms just doesn't sound right to me. I have been doing taxes for so many years that going through the handholding feature (interview function) just takes that much more time to do taxes which take way too long to do. Anyway - yeah - it has been interesting reading the VP's comments too. In my humble opinion, tax software is too expensive - yeah its complicated for sure - but to have to pay for it every year (and some will say its tax deductible - but it depends on your taxes whether you can actually write it off) at up to $100 is crazy. But I suppose if you are making $100k or more then you can afford it. Of course, probably someone making $100k or more has someone doing their taxes for them. The other thing that sometimes surprised me is how the software changes on its ease of use. One year it finally is easy to use and then the next year the software totally changes and now you have to learn a new way of moving around in the software - of course I guess if you go through the handholding feature then that doesn't matter. Well that's my 2 cents worth - but based on other reviews I see - I will be looking elsewhere this year."

Therefore I owe Virginia $119 plus interest. So I found my 2012 tax return and checked the numbers and they did not match! I have been using Turbo tax for years with the assumption that all I need to do is to enter the numbers and Turbo Tax will do the calculation for me. In this case, Turbo Tax should simply carry over that value from Schedule A to Virginia 760 Form. Unfortunate Turbo Tax did not do it for my 2012 return. I don't understand how things like this could happen. Does it mean from now on I have to manually verify all the numbers? Then what is the point of using this software?

And I can see all the stuffed suits nodding in agreement and wringing their hands. But there's one problem. Their loyal customers have told them to go pound sand and it's going to be a bloodbath when sales figures come out. Customers' backlash has hit the news outlets including the New York Times and Intuit is now in damage control mode, giving away stuff, teaming with Amazon to link your tax refund to Amazon gift cards and making deals with complaining customers on a case by case basis.

This year, Basic is not what you could buy in the past, and you need Deluxe for this form, and Premier for that form, and so on. This is not a great experience, and paying 3x for the same software and experience is not acceptable. I will not be using TurboTax this year. H&R Block will give your their Deluxe version for free if you show proof of purchase of last year's TurboTax, and frankly I am more interested in the straightforward TaxAct product pricing. I have never used H&R's or TaxAct's products, and plan on doing my taxes with both H&R and TaxAct this year to compare the two. A quick search of news will point you to info on how to get H&R for free by email only. I am at a loss to understand how Intuit and TurboTax thought this was a great business decision.

I know this because I just bought TurboTax Deluxe only to find out that it will not handle my Schedule E rental income. Now that I check the back of the box (also tauntingly displayed in the online help for UPGRADE) which I obviously did NOT do before I plunked down my hard earned money, it DOES have a little orange ""i"" next to the advanced features saying in fine print that they are now only available in the upgraded versions.

Frankly I don't see what has been added to the product other than to charge me more money. This change can be found on the website, but since I (up to this year) pre-order and download when it's time I feel mislead.

Want to raise the price on your Deluxe version, go ahead. I have no problem with a company who raises prices. I generally just say ""Hm, they raised the price this year"" and head to the check-out. However, pulling content makes me wonder if I'm in for a surprise later and THAT I deeply resent. Like others, I feel that I'm being set up for some kind of bait and switch. I was a loyal Quicken fan for many years until they pulled the plug on my 2010 version with the bank. Guess what? Once I closed out my use and started using the bank's on-line features, I didn't miss Quicken at all. The same may well happen to TurboTax.

I'm sure glad I read the reviews that Deluxe now excludes Schedule D starting with this tax year. I changed my order to Premier after using Deluxe for over a decade. I did see that big box store Costco is selling Deluxe for $40 and Premier for $55 (plus tax) for the next few weeks. One huge irritant for me with TurboTax over the years - while it can calculate quarterly estimated taxes, it does not allow me to override their figures if I want to pay a different amount on Form 1-ES.

The disingenuousness of the VP Bob Meighen who asks you to call so his ""team"" can work with you to ""get you the right product"" simply means they have the chance to sell you the upgrade since they have nothing else to offer but the upgrade if you need schedules C, D, or E before you go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere, since this company no longer has a reasonably priced product by market comparison nor any regard for their customers by the way they did this and the disingenuous explaination.

I called in and waited a long time for a call back. The person calling backed needed to gather information like my email phone mailing address. This is a waste of time and I told her I didnt want to give my mailing address. She said technical support would not speak to me without this info.

I was then told that I had to print a form and send a check to the state... even though I paid for e-filing? An Intuit rep told me that my taxes WERE e-filed correctly, and that I did not need to mail a check. Now I've invested way more time trying to sort out the mess than if I'd just mailed taxes.

""You need an upgrade to the xxx version to do the same you did last year"". When you are halfway through your taxes you almost have no choice but pay for the upgrade because who's in his/her right state of mind will buy a new product they are not familiar with and start over? I prepared and filed my taxes with TurboTax for several years but now I'm switching to the competition. I will buy whatever similar product is available out there, I just want to make sure Intuit doesn't get my business. Their total lack of transparency and respect for me as customer made me question their integrity."

1815,R1DQUC1TVLKORI,"Bad decision or good business","I suspect Intuit deployed bean counters to cull the product sales statics and generated a report that provides a stream of revenue generation at the expense of targeting a small fraction of the user base. Bad decision or good business? Depends if you are a shareholder or user in the select group. The company has no doubt hired an advertising firm to manage the message. Application software revenue is based on volume of sales. Once a product is established their market share only changes with competition or more sales. That would mean more people paying taxes. That would mean more people working. That would mean a successful economy. How do you make more money if market share doesn't fluctuate, raise the price of the whole product or raise the price of the custom product? Suspending judgment enables analysis but does little to put money in your pocket:)"

This year's ""improvement"" to Turbotax only moves Deluxe version features into the more expensive Premier, claiming that I would appreciate the change. I resent it when a successful company assumes their customers are stupid. Tax software is a competitive business, and I expect I will find something that does very well with my modest tax returns.

It's now way beyond the point of being cost effective. For that price, they should send someone to do them for me. It's also a real inconvenience buying one level through Amazon, and then having to buy the upgrade through Intuit. I used to do my taxes manually, and it wasn't that hard. I do like importing from the brokerage and electronic filing, which is the only reason I don't just do it manually. This was the last time I use TurboTax, and the last time they get any of my hard-earned money. Next year, I'll look into one of the other packages. ***Update: Since the package I paid for included the State, I tried the State package for the first time (AZ). I thought it might help with being a part time resident since I moved there during the year. It certainly wasn't much help. 1) To make any changes, it takes you through all the questions again; you can't just make changes to the particular area. 2) Not all data is pulled from the Federal form. At one point it indicates you should refer to the Federal Schedule A (that TurboTax has filled out). Not the kind of integration I expected. 3) When providing the split amounts between the states, TurboTax shows summarized values, asking how much was from each State. You have to manually go back to the Federal forms and figure out what the constituent values are and then go back to the State (starting at the beginning each time). 4) I had two W2's, and the split showed one in AZ, when both should have been in the other State. (I found this by reviewing the 140PY form). I went back to edit the AZ State return, and went through answering the questions several times, and was unable to correct the error, since it didn't show those particular values. I therefore had to change the form manually. 5) In general, I spent much more time doing manual calculations outside of TuboTax State, than I did within TurboTax State. Especially after this first year with part year residency, filling out the State form manually should be easy. Bottom line, even if I did change my mind and use TurboTax again, I wouldn't pay for the State return."

Intuit found a way to take a winner and turn it into a platinum loser with the 2014 version! First, they cheapened the Software by eliminating specific forms and guidance tools. You don't find out that the Deluxe Version is inadequate for your needs (eg., lack of K-1 and Schedule D Forms, etc ) until you're midway through Tax Preparation; suddenly you are advised that you are required to upgrade to the Premiere Version and must pay and additional $30. Oh yes, Intuit came clean AFTER THE FACT and offered some rebates. Intuit also made it possible for Deluxe Buyers to get a free upgrade to Premiere. That process added insult to injury. You must call them while in the middle of your Tax Preparation(and go through an Easter Egg Hunt to find the correct phone number); then when you get to the warning page(stating upgrade required) you need to wait on hold for a lengthy amount of time(because there are so many confused and irritated customers on hold) and then when a service representative responds, you are asked for your product serial number. This info is buried in the ""warning"" page links and none of the service reps seem to know this. If you don't have the serial number, they won't authorize the upgrade or send you the required link. After being put on hold for ten more minutes, I terminated the call, fished through the page links, and found my product serial number. I then had to call again, stay on hold almost forever and repeat my entire issue to another apologetic Rep, to get the elusive, required upgrade link.

TurboTax had a good product. I just can't understand what they were thinking. Based on all of the one star reviews I suspect they are either losing a lot of customers or have a bunch of really angry customers who bought what they did last year without realizing the change."
1853,R3DN24ZKNCARXQ,"Regular people do, in fact, need schedule C/D from time to time.","I've been using TurboTax the last few years, ever since it informed me that I could deduct part of my vehicle registration tax on schedule A as a personal property tax. I had been using H&R Block for years before that, but it never called it out that deduction and I hadn't been getting it. So I switched. Unfortunately, this year TurboTax lost me with its ridiculous, anti-customer decision to move Schedule C/D functionality out of Deluxe and only to Premier. Now, if you really did a lot with small business income or stock trading, you always wanted premier for the additional guidance. But if you had a tiny reason to use those schedules, it was really important they be in Deluxe and not cost an arm and a leg more. Let me give you an examples. Lots of people say, ""Well, you don't run a business so why would you need that (Schedule C)?"" One year I had a single small job I did that someone gave me a 1099 for (otherwise I'm just a regular employee getting W2s). TurboTax Deluxe filled in a couple blanks on schedule C and filed it. Should I really I have to pay an extra $25 bucks to handle one 1099? Here's another example. This year I bought a single stock in my IRA. Or so I thought. Unfortunately, I had selected the wrong account (I have a regular investment account and an IRA at the same company, and the accounts are together in the same dropdown box). I didn't have money for the purchase in the regular account I accidentally bought it in. I had to immediately sell. So for this year I had 1 (one) stock purchase/sale for all of 2014. It is one line on the schedule D. But Quicken wants me to pay another $25 bucks for Premier for the privilege of handling one lousy line? Regular people do sometimes need a minimum amount of schedule C/D support. You don't have to be a stockbroker or a business owner. And the explanation that ""we need to make our product consistent across mobile/web/PC devices, and mobile and web don't have this functionality"" doesn't really carry water. That's just weasel words. If you need consistency, then add schedule C/D INTO the web/mobile versions. You didn't have to take it OUT of the PC version. This year, I returned to H&R Block to give them another shot. Their Deluxe program is cheaper than Intuit's, AND it still has schedule C/D. Intuit, start treating your loyal customers better!"

Well, running 2014 Deluxe I discovered that I was solicited to pay $30 in order to upgrade to Premiere, because Deluxe no longer supports entering S corp K-1 schedule info for Schedule E. Yet I read in various posts here that Intuit had acknowledged their ""mistake"" and provided free upgrades for Deluxe customers in my situation. Well it turns out the free upgrade was only if you filed your return by April 30, 2015. The irony is TT reps have stated here that they will have this ""fixed"" for 2015 returns, which means that for some reason the only customers ""burned"" by this are those who bought their TT Deluxe in good faith in order to file their 2014 returns on extension. WHY should WE be penalized?! I paid the $30 begrudgingly, because I had done most of the work and wasn't included to start all over with H&R Block software. As far as I am concerned if a tax software is going to drop a major component of what they cover, it's obligated to make this clear in its marketing both in online descriptions and on the box itself. Nowhere does it indicate that Sch K-1 coverage has been dropped. The software seems to work fine, as it did last year. But this kind of ""bait and switch"" marketing, just to drain more money out of customers.... this just isn't do right by regular customers."

1877,R1JSXLQEN5X2YN,"Why Intuit has stubbed their toe big time on the removed functionality and what to do about it","Mr. Meighan, It should be apparent from all the negative reviews here that the ""downgrades"" to the Deluxe version have greatly alienated a lot of very loyal customers. The mere fact that you've had to write an open letter and respond to so many reviews should tell you something. When I started using TT in the late 90's, there weren't a lot of other choices but I was happy with your product and remained a customer since that time. I'm also a dedicated Quicken users and like the fact the two programs can ""talk"" to one another. FWIW, I also taught college in Fredericksburg, Va. and had dozens of your employees come through my classes and hopefully provided them with some additional business management skills to benefit Intuit. All this is background to let you know they don't come any more committed then me, even though I'm usually angry when I'm forced to upgrade my Quicken periodically but I always bite the bullet and do so. Now I'm ready to start the initial work on my 2014 taxes, come to Amazon to download TT and as always, research what others have experienced. Now I'm hearing things like ""reduced functionality"" or ""hey, you can still mail it in with those schedules"". Well, who mails their tax returns when they are using software to prepare them? Plus, I wish to file online to take advantage of the Amazon 10% gift card bonus, something I don't believe I can do if filing my mail. Just my own opinion, but when almost half the early adopters of the 2014 software are slamming it for these changes, it is perhaps time to look inward and consider that perhaps Intuit has made a huge error and take steps to correct it. Perhaps you need, as a corporation, to bit the bullet and pull Deluxe from the market and offer the Premier edition for the remainder of the tax season at the same price as Deluxe. Will it hurt profits? Sure. Will it build customer goodwill - you betcha! Will it insure returning customers keep returning and keep referring others - Absolutely! If you continue down this road of answering negative reviews with what is basically a ""you can make it work - sort of"", you are going to maximize short term profits at the expense of long term customer retention. If I taught your employees anything, I hope it was that a customer is the most valuable commodity a company has and don't ever, ever loose them over foolish, and preventable, reasons. It costs WAY more to get them back then it does to keep them. Thank you. Update 03/18/15: Fairness works in both directions and so I must acknowledge that Intuit finally recognized the error of their ways and corrected the problem. Better late than never certainly applies here and it looks like they've already committed to next years product returning to the old one we all knew and loved. No doubt from the reviews here that Intuit did a great deal of corporate PR damage.

There are several other quite functional products on the market, but none of them are provided by an organization that, in my opinion, is so untrustworthy that they would cavalierly kick their loyal customers in the teeth by severely reducing the functional support that their product provides, and then not even have the courtesy to let them know about it. I have been a loyal user of TurboTax since their very earliest beginnings. For me (I own some mutual funds, stocks and a rental property), the reductions in product functionality for the Deluxe version amount to a 50% reduction in capability when it comes to helping me deal with the complexity of the tax code and the resulting amount of time it consumes (isn't that the whole point of the product?). Now, I would have to step up to the Premier edition, at a 50% increase in price, just to retain the functionality that TurboTax has been providing over the years. A loyal customer since 1991 - - that was me. I don't know about you, but when someone treats a loyal customer with such disregard, the real question is ""where is the nearest exit? I'm out of here!"". Fortunately, there are several well-reviewed alternatives in the marketplace, and they all provide the ability to import your TurboTax data from last year's return without a hitch. It's an easy decision, don't you think? Hey, TurboTax, I'd like you to leave my home now. Oh, and please don't let the door hit you in the butt on the way out."

If I could rate this on a negative scale, I'd choose minus 5 stars! Greedy Intuit has done it again by removing Schedule C, which self-employed people use, along with Schedules D, and E. Also, you no longer get a free state with this ""Deluxe"" version! For that matter, with the ""Premier"" version, you will not get one lousy free state download and there are *still* a few missing schedules as noted in the above. To add insult to injury, even the plain old sounding and most expensive Home and Business 2014 doesn't include a free state download. Intuit must think these state forms are liquid gold, but in reality they are simple, short forms you could easily do by hand if you wanted to! I'm DONE with TurboTax! Here's your opportunity H&R Block and TaxAct to move right on in! From this point onward I wouldn't even buy a copy of TurboTax on the black market or download a copy from a rogue site or snag a copy on a CD from a paying customer! It's a matter of principle! This was a sneaky bait and switch tactic . . . Intuit's apology having something to do with ""reducing customer confusion"" and not doing enough to ""communicate the change"" falls on deaf ears and insults my intelligence (yeah, you're sorry you didn't do enough to let us know you were cheating us and misrepresented your products with the same names with fewer features!)

Because of the backlash from customers, Intuit announced a free upgrade for 2013 CD users who downloaded the 2014 software this year. The upgrade was reported by the company to happen within the automatic updates for the software. This is not the case. You must call Intuit support and give them a serial number (when you are prompted for a paying upgrade, click the button, then select, at the bottom of the next box, the option of having trouble/need help. You will be given a serial number and a phone number to call). I'm now on hold with Intuit, which I've been told can take an hour or more. I'm now at minute 8. And there is no guarantee of receiving the upgrade, as it's dependent on the discretion of the representative.

Intuit's very limited apologies are only for doing the price increase in a sneaky manner. 2) Intuit has a long history of taking advantage of customers to make more profit. It's difficult to change to a new kind of software; that difficulty provides many avenues of abuse. (My opinions, based on many years of doing technology support.) 3) The U.S. government has a corrupt tax system. The tax system in the U.S. is so complex that even CPAs and Tax professionals easily say they don't fully understand it. If you love the U.S. like I do, I think you will agree we need to make taxes less complex. The present system is arranged to make money for lawyers and tax accountants. 4) The U.S. government must provide tax software, either online or downloadable. At present, the necessity to buy tax software is like a tax on tax returns, but the money goes to a huge corporation for private profit. If the U.S. government supplies tax software, the government would then be responsible for any errors or omissions in the software. Any tax law would not be considered complete until the government's software implements the law."

But based on all the review for 2014, I am going to STOP using TurboTax - because I think TT made a strategic product decision to change their 'product structure' for more profit. Pretty sure they calculated that with the customers they lost they will make them up more than they lost with the 'upgrades'. I think it take some deliberate effort and contemplation to lose a 'bunch of' 15-20 year customers. And switching software is tricky. If I found other software that can do the same job just as good, and cost effective, I am not going to bother to look at TT in 2015, 6, 7... to see 'if they have reverted' and switch back. It is so hard to win a customer, and even harder to keep them, but so easy to lose one. Someone in TT lost his/her head(s) in the decision, and will lost their heads again when they were shown out the door. And on their resume : head of TT 2014 upgrade. And they are definitely A-head."

I tried contacting Intuit and was told I would have to pay for cust servWhile I guess I am partially to blame for my ignorance on the required tax forms to submit. I trusted the software implictily.

I hope the geniuses at Intuit who thought this was a good idea don't let the door hit them on the way out when they get their pink slips. If the feedback that is being left on Amazon is any indication, I think this is really going to hurt their bottom line, as it should. I just purchase the H&R Block Deluxe tax program for $22.00 (on sale today at Amazon).

By the way TT almost lost me forever the last time Intuit put their boot to our throats. I used TaxCut that year.

1941,RON2Z6TRE6STX,"We dove into our taxes and ran into the missing sched D problem like millions of others","Really awful trick on loyal customers. My story real quick. I purchased my usual TT Deluxe at Costco with $10 automatic rebate. We dove into our taxes and ran into the missing sched D problem like millions of others. My wife was like ""let's just upgrade to premier"" but I was really upset. In the midst of my upset I heard about the HR Block free offer if you sent in a copy of your TT receipt - which I did. One day later I got a return e-mail with the download link and activation code. No attempt to scam - just downloaded and activated and it worked. Did my taxes this weekend. Imported last year TT return without problem. Completed my return and filed online - no issues at all. Smart marketing move by HR Block. They must have picked up millions of new customers. And a comment to the Intuit board of directors and share holders: why does ""Bob Meighan, VP, TurboTax"" still have a job? Serious question."

1943,R2LHMJRFUSZZ8Z,"Rebate or Upgrade Only Applies to 2013 Customers","Like many other reviewers I was upset about the 2014 version of TurboTax Deluxe not including support for schedule D as it has in the past. I had read that Intuit, maker of TurboTax, was going to give returning customers a free upgrade because of all the confusion about the limited capabilities of the Deluxe version. I have used TurboTax for over 20 years. Last year I started a small business and had an accountant prepare both my business and personal taxes so I did not purchase the 2013 version. I purchased the 2014 version to do my mother's taxes but now I find out that the $25 refund or free upgrade for the 2014 version only applies to customers who bought the 2013 version as well. It did not matter that I had been a loyal customer for the 20 plus years prior to 2013. Amazon is complicit in this deception since their bold header for this years version shows ""FREE UPGRADE OR CASH BACK FOR RETURNING TURBOTAX DELUXE DESKTOP CUSTOMERS"". Shame on you TurboTax and shame on you as well Amazon! TurboTax you have lost a loyal customer."
1944,R12PMB0563EC7K,"Switched to H&R Block Tax Software","After 10+ years of using TurboTax I have switched to H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State 2014 Win.

1945,R29LV6YRTGK8LV,"Glad I did","Been using Turbo Tax for 20 years. Got lots of bundles over the years. Didn't care it cost more than others. Was about to order Turbo Tax Deluxe and thought to read some reviews. Glad I did. It would not have worked for me. I remember a few years ago Intuit tried to charge extra if you wanted to do more than 1 return. They ended up refunding everyone their money that paid for that and took out that restriction. Looks like Intuit is always looking for a way to gouge their loyal customers. A friend's been using H&R Block Deluxe for many years so I bought it instead while Amazon had it for $21. Intuit, your greed lost you another 20 year loyal customer. Hope it was worth it to you."
1946,R2ML9VRX5SIUP0,"Be very careful of Intuit going forward.","The decision is yours. After passing email with Bob M at TurboTax and reading various reviews I am even more disappointed in Intuit for this move. So far they have various reasons ranging from ""We warned you when we advertised features"" to ""You didn't need it anyway"" to ""You should not have had those capabilities anyway"" to ""We'll help you upgrade at no cost just for this year."" There has to be a reason that their rating has dropped from 4 stars to 2 stars. The multi-platform and multiple devices explanation does not fly because they are talking about very limited use products for a small number of people. Now, going a step further I must ask the question: ""IS INTUIT PLANNING TO DO THE SAME WITH QUICKEN AND QUICKBOOKS"" that they have done with TurboTax? What happens when you update Quicken Deluxe only to find it has been gutted and now you have to buy Quicken Home and Business. My solution at least temporarily: I have bought and installed Block's offering which at about $50 does all that TurboTax Home and Business does. I am going to buy and install TurboTax 2014 Deluxe and do the offered free upgrade. Going to run my taxes through both. I have schedules C, D and E - not a simple return. Will post comments on results later."

I used to use AM-Tax (anyone remember it back in the DOS days?) and when it went away I moved to TurboTax. Remember when you could purchase TT and get an upgrade or Quicken Basic? Remember how Intuit screwed that up? I think I've been using TurboTax mainly because I've become very comfortable with it. Well, with the latest TurboTax I've become uncomfortable and so I just purchased H&R Block Deluxe. It costs less and does more. I'm hoping to get ""comfortable"" with it and use it for many years..."

As they had promised, I was trying to upgrade to Premier for free yet it did not work (end up paying the regular fees of $30). The customer service person was not even aware of this big announcement Intuit had made and she was trying to making me pay to become a ""member"" so to speak with Technical Support. Not only this situation being so frustrating, it did not help at all when this person had no idea how to talk to their customers. Rude and very unprofessional. It is hard to believe someone like her is representing this big corporation. I am very disappointed with their service. I will never use their product again."

They deliberately lead people with ""Start for Free,"" and once all the computations are completed, drop the bomb that one must pay much more for services that were previously included in the Deluxe Edition. No more free state filing, so add 39.95. Unbelievable. I hope other more ethical software developers step into the huge space Intuit has just created. Another review suggested H&R Block. It cost less and was up front about fees. With some initial struggling to import my 2013 Turbo Tax files, I completed my taxes without too much sweat or cost. Turbo Tax was my go-to software for years. Never again."

Here's a quaint notion; If you want to generate more revenue, just raise prices. Give the client less and charge more; There's a viable TT Mission Statement. There is no level of disdain that cannot be achieved when ethics is checked at the door. I contacted TT Customer Service and fortunately they made me whole by providing the Premier upgrade at no additional cost. The Lady I spoke with (Tina) was extremely personable, sympathetic and accommodating. Because of her care and caring, I will remain with TT. My heart goes out to TT's Customer Service Representatives. They are looking right down the gun barrel of the self inflicted mess that their superiors mindlessly created."

Yes, you've said you'll now let people upgrade for free - but those of us that have already been forced to shell out an additional $30 plus tax are stuck with only getting $25 back - you are still keeping $5 plus tax from early purchasers - $5 that you don't deserve. This feels like such a cheat I doubt I will be buying any INTUIT products in the future - no more underhanded surprises for me. It is amazing that a company that had such a good reputation, no, a great reputation, could do this --- reading all your negative reviews I have to ask..... was it worth the extra $5?????"

I purchased the Deluxe Edition because it had Schedule C, D and E. I was going to buy the Deluxe as usual for 2014 and low and behold, I can no longer use the Deluxe Edition. I have to cough an extra $15 for the Premier Edition. It's not like living on a fixed income is easy. Let's see, Property taxes went up, income taxes went up, all the insurance went up (car, home and health care - about $6,000 in 3 years). I can't believe that Intuit spokes person Colleen Gatlin actually had the intestinal fortitude to say, âThe majority of the customers who understand the changes are OK with it,â. We're the ones that know about the change and are not okay with it. I bet Colleen received a big fat bonus to product that line. Surely Intuit can't believe we're that stupid, can they?"

1959,R39U3CK4JGEPZ8,"Poor customer service","The software did an adequate job of compiling a simple tax return, however there customer service is poor at best. I purchased a second state for $39.99 and could not get it to load after completing the purchase. I called their customer service line and, after describing my problem, the person I spoke to said they needed to ""transfer me to another department"" but instead simply hung up --- dial tone. I called back and got the same routine with someone else, but when they tried to ""transfer"" me I told him not to do that because I was hung up on last time. He told me to hold and he would get his supervisor to help me, he then proceeded to hang up on me -- dial tone again. If I got hung up on once, I could believe it's a bad apple or someone who had a bad day. Getting hung up on twice indicates this is is simply part of the Intuit culture; in a word: worthless. But you live and learn and move on. There are a number of other tax preperation software packages which I'll get looking into for next year"

Pros: The question-based guidance makes it reasonably easy to complete your taxes. Guided or unguided, the interface works. The updates are also helpful. Cons: Customer confusion on versions to buy. I have been a deluxe customer for years. Bought deluxe again to find that most of the basic stuff I have always had was GONE. Intuit really screwed this up. The stars are taken off for price-gouging your loyal customers. Had you kept your original feature-set, you would have gotten five stars. If Intuit pulls this @^%@%$^ again next year, I am done with TurboTax. There are other capable packages out there that cost significantly less."
1961,R3FOK4GJRSGDL4,"No Snow Leopard support for 2014.","Besides the missing forms issue, which has been commented on by many, many people, this seems to be the first year that the Mac version of TurboTax will not work natively on Snow Leopard (10.6.8). A still fairly large percentage of Mac users are using Snow Leopard, so this seems like an additional poke in the eye to the customer base. FYI: A work around is to install the Windows version on a Parallels virtual machine and use Unity mode. That allows for cross platform functionality so that data from 2013 can be imported, etc. Doesn't solve the missing forms issue of course. Like everyone else, I will be looking for a different solution next year after 20 years of using MacInTax and then Turbo Tax. I had already purchased and installed TT Deluxe at Costco, so it was too late to switch for this year."
1962,R216KPEYLLY77B,"Turbo Tax Deluxe is Terrible. It is the Basic version @ Deluxe pricing.","It is terrible. Intuit changed deluxe without any warning. I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years and it had been great. My son tried totalk me into using H&R Blocks software and I said no because Turbo Tax Deluxe had always done a great job. This year with NO notification took out schedules C, D and E and forces you to upgrade for another $30 to premier. I returned it to Costco and explained how I felt about Intuit's Turbo Tax. I tried to call Turbo Tax directly but all I could get was a busy signal, so I assume there are a lot of people upset with Intuit's Turbo Tax decision to downgrade it to the Basic and still charge a high price. DON""T BUY IT."

After reading the ""Responses from the Seller"" indicating that the issue with missing forms and schedules was being addressed with a free upgrade, I went ahead and purchased the Deluxe Package. Apparently it doesn't apply to those of us who chose to use the online platform last year. Thinking it would be more convenient to just keep files in the cloud, so I wouldn't have to worry about changing computers or crashed drives, I made the switch last year after over two decades of buying the disks. Now it's costing me an additional $30 (plus tax) because I made the switch. Next year I'll bite the bullet and take the time to learn a different tax prep program. Even if it's not as polished as TTax, at least I'll feel better spending my money with a company that's more transparent with their pricing and capabilities."

I had to keep cycling and pray that my return would go through. Worthless. I'll vouch on the price gouging aspect too. I ended up skipping a lot of deductions forms because they removed access to them (schedule D). Nothing better than buying a ""deluxe"" version that charges you extra to do what it used to do. I only usually get a very small amount back so it wasn't worth the cost since I didn't have any major investments or expenses, etc. What's worse is you can see that they knew for months that people were unhappy with the product (the comments on the reviews date back to 2014) and they didn't update anything. Yeah, really inspiring trust there. I used H&R last year, which wasn't as good as the Turbotax I remembered, but it was decent enough. However THIS Turbotax is definitely not the Turbotax you remembered and barely workable. Get H&R next year."

I got the version I needed (which includes Schedule D), with State filing, here at Amazon on sale for under $21.00. I started my return, importing last year's password-protected TurboTax file with no problems. So far, it seems as easy to use as TurboTax.

They should not be taking out the Schedule Forms which are now missing. I have been using Turbo Tax for almost 20 years now and even back then, I thought that the program was expensive. Now they are taking away some of the Schedule forms of the program requiring customer to pay more for the normal program function. I will no longer use them. Will return my product.

I have used this product for years but this may be the last straw. It is impossible to get the upgrade. The free upgrade feature in the software does not work. The tech support lines have pathetic wait times...I tried for three days. I finally had a call back from tech support and was told they could not help me.

I don't know who wrote the lame letter that came from the head of your company, but it was weak and did nothing to encourage me to continue using Turbo Tax. The letter claimed that Turbo Tax did not do an adequate job of explaining the need to upgrade to a more costly product, even though Deluxe has worked all these years. Saying you did not do an adequate job of explaining the changes to your customer base doesn't even come close to the ""nothing"" that I received. I know you have records of who has used which version of Turbo Tax in past years, and could have easily notified your customers of the upcoming changes long before I purchased the software December 26th. I hope you'll consider refunding the full upgrade cost instead of only $25."

I almost bought the Deluxe version which I have used for years until I noticed the very low review stars . As I read the reviews I realized what was going on . I would have had to upgrade . I will investigate the H&R block product and if it does everything I need ( I have a very complex return with cost basis in an IRA that I am taking MRDs from) I will switch and wage an Internet awareness campaign about this deception."

Intuit is now constantly advertising and trying to upsell their customers. I recently cancelled an online QuickBooks account for the same reason. And Quicken is getting worse each year too and pops up ads to me. That makes me furious when I am working and an ad pops up...this is not FREEWARE software!

So I decided to manually input my information from Quicken and I upgraded to Premier, only to find that I need to upgrade to Home and Business to include a single Schedule C item! I'm not looking for any features from TurboTax, just a simple tax form! I'm switching to TaxAct, abandoning Quicken for Pwersonal Capital (I've been using Mint - but I'm now against using any Intuit product or service).

1979,R1DHQZG8UCXIRD,"Intuit TurboTax Deluxe Pre-review","None of us have filed tax returns for 2014 yet, so every review of the product to this point is a pre-review. I haven't purchased TurboTax Deluxe yet, and probably will not do so this year. On a personal level, I am unsettled about all of the really negative reviews of Intuit Turbotax, but they are consistent with my own observations of TurboTax through the years. TurboTax is expensive, and I can't understand why the prices are so high. Intuit has a large share of the accounting and tax return business already, and doing tax returns is not rocket science anymore. Yeah, the crummy federal tax laws are intentionally complicated, the states are all different, and technology is changing a bit, but when you are a big established company like Intuit, if you can't keep up, maybe you should be doing something else. From the customer's perspective, I see a lot of long time customers being frustrated by this year's TurboTax, especially the Deluxe version. Why is that? Why not give more for less? Does Intuit think they own the market and can charge whatever the hell they want to charge? Does that make any sense? Yes, we Americans are all 'enjoying' the economic depression imposed on us by a runaway and lawless federal government and a criminal federal reserve banking system, and our personal and business costs are rising every single year. A full restaurant dinner in 1970 was about $.80 - today it is over $8.00. We can thank the fed and their co-conspirators in the federal government for that problem. I'm sure that, like us, Intuit's costs are also rising, but it seems that this year they will be losing many customers. Ooops. Did they mean for that to happen? As an aside, I just briefly reviewed the H&R software, and guess what - there is a TurboTax import capability and the H&R Deluxe cost is apparently much less than TurboTax Deluxe. Do you think many TurboTax customers are going to be looking for alternative tax returns this year? It would seem that way. Anyway, I don't mean to rant on and on, but I am beginning to think someone at Intuit has screwed the pooch on this one. Onward and sideways as the old expression used to say? Let's all of us keep talking and reviewing this kind of software as our needs and goals are clearly different than those of Intuit and H&R. Competition is good for everyone, and there appear to be no sacred cows in the tax preparation business anymore. Another aside, I keep waiting for people to start asking why, if Americans only deal in fiat, debt based currency, and have no real wealth, profit, or income anymore, is there any obligation to file tax returns in the first place. But, hey, maybe that's just poor dumb me asking. ;-) Happy New Year!"

To do so, they con you into starting on online return with the premise that its free or will eventually take you to a purchase selection screen....nope. No instructions on how to simply buy the software, poor clarity of purpose on their primary site and no way to back out or delete the return that you start on line. From there it went downhill badly. Every time I needed to interface their software with the internet I had to call the help desk and wait 2 hours on their helpdesk....2+ hours to upgrade to Premium, 2 hours to download the state and now the same issues with Efiling. Too bad Intuit, you have really lost your way and a good loyal customer....or thousands based on these reviews.

Last year I did my taxes with TurboTax like I have for the last 10 years. I owed, and I owed a lot more than seemed reasonable. I have a friend who does taxes for a living as an independent business, so I had her over to review what I did. She went through each step, it looked right, but then went into the actual forms step by step and found a place where you click on a button to optimize your return, clicked it, and dropped our taxes by hundreds of dollars. Why this button is hidden away and why TT doesn't calculate it without having to dig for it, I don't know, but this year I am going to try another tax software."

Later that day, friends told me to just send in paper forms adjusted correctly by hand instead. The next day, as I went to print the forms I tried one more time to click on ""head of household"" and it worked. My tax dropped to $66. Probably using another tax service next year!

Yes, I could have read the reviews beforehand to see this, but I didn't think it necessary for a product that I'd been using for well over ten years. Needless to say, instead of Intuit getting another $40 from me, I purchased the H&R Block software for less than that. And it allowed my to complete my Schedule C!"

What's more, that upgrade fee is significantly more than if I had known and bought the premier edition from the beginning. I don't know if it's price gouging or simple stupidity. Also, the product failed to prompt me to import my 2013 return, requiring me to re-enter information and possibly make mistakes in the process. I don't remember anything like that in the old versions Something else I noticed: after entering a 1099-MISC, it forced me to choose from four options, none of which actually applied to my situation.

What a disaster, and this was my trying to pay extra $30 for premier. Instead, I went through Amazon and upgraded for $15. So, Turbo lost half of its upgrade because its customer service stinks.

Despite the straightforward return, Intuit has designed a product that requires me to buy their most expensive product. The tax code is too complicated to have so many iterations of the software, which is creating their issues. They should take a lesson from competitors and have only two versions - basic and premium. Keep it simple! Taxes are hard enough for people as it is..."

The reason being that Intuit effectively get 50% more revenue for the same product capabilities when compared to 2013. Next year I will know better and read the details of H&R Block's tax S/W before I buy it. Intuit got an extra $30 from me this year. Next year they get nothing."

The software finally installed, but then I had only days to file, and have now found that the state software won't load. As I type, I am on the phone again -- on hold again -- for over an hour and counting, trying to talk to someone who can help with the sate download. Overall, the amount of pain associated with Turbotax this year has greatly outweighed any cost savings of it versus just using a CPA. This is the last year, after 23, that I will use Turbotax. It has not gotten better with age."

As a previous Turbotax customer I've switched to H&R Block. Recently Turbotax has announced ""free"" upgrades, etc to try to fix their problem. Too late, I'm going to reward the company who gives me honest features for a fair price. Intuit will need to be vastly better to ever get my business back not just equivalent. Bad move..."

Did you wish to change your software to better serve everyone? No problems. Why did you have to charge me extra? The software costs the same to you once your write it, it's all a licensing scheme.

This year, due to all the negative reaction to this, TurboTax built in a free upgrade, which in my case required upgrading to Home and Business. If they keep the Deluxe version crippled next year, it will mean paying an $30 extra for Home/Business. That seems unfair and, if that happens, I'll be looking elsewhere for software. Hopefully the outcry this year has prompted Intuit to consider changes for upcoming editions. If not, based on the number of negative reviews, I think they can expect to see a significant exodus of those of us who have been loyal customers for years."
2010,R3Y8SG5J9YRNI,"INTUIT clearly make a huge mistake - but they made it right for me this year - for 2015, they're halfway back","I purchased TT Deluxe from Costco, having used this product for more than twenty years. The guidance on what version to buy has consistently offered additional features regarding stock sales for the version above Deluxe including lookup of historical stock prices, features that I didn't need, but this year, without any clear warning, Intuit has seen fit to remove the long-present functionality of Schedules C, D, and E from the Deluxe version. I read the comparison chart carefully, but because of their previous guidance, it wasn't at all clear that this version was entirely crippled in this respect. I went ahead and bought TT Delux, just as I had done for many years. I wasn't aware of this problem until reading the headline on slashdot.org, which led me to detailed articles and the amazon.com reviews. I see Intuit claims that this removal of functionality was ""in order to make the product line more consistent,"" but surely consistency can be achieved two ways - one could have added functionality to the online version to match the offline version, but NOOOOO, they saw fit to remove functionality from the offline version to match the crippled online version. That decision was clearly wrong as customers would certainly expect consistent features from the 2014 TT Deluxe version as compared to the 2013 TT Deluxe version. This represents a huge price increase to get the same product as I obtained in previous years. INTUIT, I intend to take you up on the offer of a free upgrade for long-standing customers to a version that meets the product I bought so faithfully over the years. If that works, I'll edit this review to tell you how easy or difficult the process was - if it doesn't work out, I'll let you know that too - and intend to return the product for a refund. I see that others are making the shift to competitors products that are apparently much cheaper - so raising the price of TT could cost INTUIT a huge bundle. I'm hereby putting INTUIT on notice that I fully expect them to make this right in future years. [EDIT as promised above]: By the time I used the product, the process for upgrading had been streamlined, and was fairly painless. Based upon whatever information they had, when I got to the point of entering stock sales and purchases, it prompted me for a free upgrade that took a little time to download, and after yet another restart of the software, worked as previous years' versions did regarding stock transactions. At the time that I'm editing this review (Jan 2016), Intuit has promised that they've heard the complaints and are restoring the schedule D to the Deluxe 2015 disk and download versions, but not the online versions. I'm still finding their version comparisons misleading in this respect: there are pages with large buttons asking what features you need, and these pages guide those with investments toward the Premier version. It's only by looking at some fine print at the bottom that they claim that they've restored the forms that were in the 2013 version into the 2015 version. They vaguely offer that the Premier version has ""extra help"" for those with investments, leaving it unclear what assistance is built into the the Deluxe version. One would expect to find the automatic downloading of investments into the forms, but can I be sure? Again, only time and experience will tell, and given my usual procrastination on tax matters, I'll discover that at the last minute. The net result, I'm setting this review to Three Stars, as these shenanigans still markedly reduce the comfort that this version has what I need. Intuit really needs to make their feature more clear. Notably, now they again have differing feature levels between their online and disk/download versions, and while they could have made the online feature match the disk/download features, they chose not to.

For the slight increase in cost, all I have to do is hand over a stack of paper and go home to relax.

I had to work directly in the 2106 form to make the correct entries.

Turbotax likes to separate the price of a state e-file from their base price to keep the initial cost down, and make you pay the extra fee before you file. That's annoying, but, I expect that. What i don't expect is to not be able to pay the fee because of a problem on their end, and being shuffled to generic browser support tips when it doesn't. Every question on their support site goes like this. Q: ""Hey, I'm trapped under a car and I think my legs are broken!"" A: ""I understand that being trapped under a car with your legs broken is frustrating. We want to do whatever we can to help you. Please follow the tips listed here to reset your web browser. If you are still trapped under the car, just wait and we'll resolve it.""

It's because stock trading is more prevalent among those on the higher income scale.

I gave up on one that seemed promising after waiting over an hour.The main problems started when I was finished with my returns. I wanted to order Audi Defense but forgot my password. That got me into a loop where I couldn't get rid of the sign in page. If I signed in, all I got was a page of advertising asking which product I wanted to buy. THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS LOOP, AND IT COMPLETELY BLOCKED ACCESS TO THE SOFTWARE UNDERNEATH. So I couldn't get to the filing section, or any section, because all of the toolbar options were grayed out. I couldn't quit TTx because it said I had to finish the dialog, which of course I could not even reach. Same for trying to shut down the computer. Eventually I had to force quit TTx, which could have caused a loss of the data, but fortunately it did not. That's not all. I wanted to print a copy of my returns before filing to study to make sure I had added everything necessary. No. Have to file first. So I chose send by mail, printed the copy, and then went back to file by email. This was the most user unfriendly version I've ever worked with. The help you used to be able to get was nonexistent, or at least I couldn't find where I could easily talk to a human, or even chat online. Never again!

One day, I updated TurboTax just because I wanted to have the more recent version, I saw my taxes changed! I immediately freaked out because I had already filed online and everything was accepted. After reviewing my returns again, I realized the 3805P is now filled and I owed additional taxes. I later found out that this was an error in TurboTax and was fixed after I filed.

I purchased it this year at Costco and found the changes that TurboTax had made, and I was just as disgusted as the hundreds of other users who have reviewed this product, with the changes they had made. Changing the price is one thing, but forcing someone to upgrade after purchasing it in order for them to be able to do what they expected the product to do, is another. I saw, and still do see the companies attempt to win back their loyal customers, but to me that is little more than a bribe. That doesn't settle with me very well. To my way of thinking, they thought that they could treat us with contempt and simply get away with it. I admit that I wasted some money that I didn't need to. I did that by uninstalling TurboTax, and throwing it away. I then purchased H&R Block. I found no major difference in the way the two programs performed. I did come up with one problem with H&R Block. I bought it with the State filing because I had some income from a state that I do not reside in. It turned out that this software did not allow me to file in the State that I needed to, and I don't have any idea why. It worked out better though. This could be a coincidence because I really have no way of knowing. However, last year using TurboTax to file my state taxes, for the same income, in the same state, I paid 5 times as much in State taxes as I did this year doing that same State return by hand. It took me an hour and a half and a $.49 postage stamp. Maybe the State taxes did change that much from this year compared to last year but it seemed a little weird. TurboTax, feel free to have one of your corporate people run a counter statement against my review. It may help stem your losses, but It will not change my mind because I no longer trust you, and you will not get my trust back again. Just because you try to make things right by offering a refund, or an upgrade, isn't enough to bring back trust that has been lost. At least not mine."

Until this year, I relied on these guys (used the online deluxe version) and filing taxes was a smooth procedure. This year I when I came back I was shocked by the steep price increase compared to the last year. The deluxe online program had costed me $30 for 2013 taxes and with the 10% amazon gift card option I had offset the purchase. However this year the online version price was $60 and the gift card option was not there (at least for me). I found a $10 off deal (coupons.com partnered with turbotax) but although it was legitimate, somehow the website prevented me to take advantage of that deal, on top of that I was not even asked for the gift card option as well (5% was mentioned in some places). I kept filling the form hoping that it will finally give me the option to take advantage of these benefits but NO, they had gone crazy and just asked for my credit card details right before submitting (They even ask for an additional $40 processing fee if you choose the option of letting them take the money from your return instead of credit card...) Having spent 3 hours on preparing my taxes I had two options: Surrender and pay the full $60 price and forget about all the deals for the sake of convenience or just start over somewhere else. I chose the second option and went to H and R block free version. It took me another 2 hours to fill the form from scratch in H&R website but in the meanwhile I realized that they actually have no difference at all. Similar questions, warnings, alerts, security check points, similar algorithm in comparing standard vs itemized deductions, similar level of instructions etc. And the final tax return H and R calculated was the same up to the last coin. On top of that even this free version was offering 5% bonus if I wanted to get part of my return in gift cards ( Target, starbucks, homedepot etc. in $100 increments.) I was happy with the result and filed it all for free with no hassle. If your taxes are relatively simple like me (married filing jointly, having W2 from employer, kids in daycare, house with mortgage, some interest from basic saving accounts, not too much work related deductibles and a few charitable donations) then go for it you won't even feel the difference. For those who have more complicated situations, it is up to you. (Honestly, I think the free H&R is still as good for anyone that thinks of getting TurboTax deluxe) Conclusion: I am sorry Turbotax, you have lost a customer for good... and you know what, just for the sake of convenience I was ready to pay the increased price if you at least let me take advantage of these discounts. But instead, you guys forced me to pay the full doubled price and that really pissed me off... Note: I gave it a 2 stars instead of 1 only for the sake of the good old days..."

It is supposed to be seamless from within the program. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bought the product. Well I'm in the program and I've used Deluxe or Home & Business for 10+ years so I figure I should qualify for the upgrade, and they're still trying to take $30 from me. Note this is just so I can report a $6 gain on a cash distribution for a partial share. Other than that I have no investment activity to report. I can forgive them for making a change and then admitting the mistake, but I'm still being told to come up with $30 to get the functionality that I was told the program would upgrade to for free (as part of their sorry-we-tried-trick-you modification).

After twenty years (since 1995) of subtle greed that was annoying, they finally went too far for me. I uninstalled it and downloaded H&R Block. The writing to the boot track fiasco a decade ago should have been a warning that they were more concerned about missing out on a few dollars than providing a safe, usable and effective customer experience. Spending millions to oppose allowing taxpayers to file simple returns for free should have been a warning that they favored coercion to increase profits. There is no technical reason for removing code other than to reduce the cost of maintaining and updating the software... they saved a little money producing Deluxe and also made a little money by forcing users to upgrade... win-win for Intuit. As a business owner, Intuit had already forced me to abandon QuickBooks and TurboTax H&B for the same reason and now I have successfully eliminated everything Intuit from my personal activities."

Now the input I got hit on was a $5 input and Intuit wanted $30 more for the upgrade. What really upset me was the difference in price on Amazon was only $15. Of course when I did the tax audit, Turbo Tax didn't catch the discrepancy and give me the go ahead. So I really don't know if I trust the software or not. Of course I could trust on their guarantee.... Otherwise the software was easy to use and interpret."

Well, I was wrong. First off, they updated the system requirements. You need a min of MacOS 10.7 â so I canât even run it. After I called I was told the only option was to do it online which I didnât want to do. They said theyâd give me a code to upgrade to premier and another to file a 2nd return (disk allows 5). Since the rep would need to get someone else involved to get the codes for me I told them Iâd think about it and call back. Which I did last night. After 10 minutes on hold my call was dropped. Called again and spoke with a couple of people. After 104 minutes on the phone, yes, thatâs One Hundred Four minutes, I found out, that premier wouldnât let me do the schedule C which I needed, (and have used on Deluxe going back to â06) and they wouldnât provide me an upgrade to the necessary version. For years Iâve been telling people how happy I was with TurboTax. Well, no more. I couldnât be less happy. I donât know how the number of people necessary to institute these changes could all agree this was a good idea. It is a total FAIL. Iâm off to H&R Blockâs Tax Software (Tax Act which is rated higher is only available for PCs) and Iâm sure Iâll have a much easier time completing my taxes than TurboTax will have of ever getting me back as a customer, let alone brand advocate."

Next year I won't do this again. I really don't use a lot of the import features in turbotax and after reading reviews I see it is time to move on from intuit. Shame.....I have used tubotax for not just years.....but decades. Pretty poor practices to treat your customers this way. Same with quicken.....I've used it for decades but I am the silly one who upgrades every couple of years because I lose my functionality only to buy a version that really isn't any different and tablet features that are really pretty useless and slow down the program.

What were they thinking?! I had always used the Basic version, even though I always had a fairly complicated Sch C and Sch E. It did the job. But I was warned off by the many negative reviews of the changes in this year's release, so I decided to give HR Block a try. This year's Block Deluxe cost me no more than previous Basic versions from Turbo Tax. This year I didn't cuss at HR Block, not even once. I will never go back to Turbo Tax. HR Block is SO much easier that it isn't even funny. The only complaint I have is that the form view is in a strange format, a little hard to read. But it is superior in every other way. And it DIDN'T make any mistakes! So yes, this isn't a review of this year's Turbo Tax-- I didn't use it. But if you've never tried HR Block, this is the perfect year to do so.

While I am not happy to have to learn a new way to do my taxes, I could not justify buying a product from a company that disrespects its customers. It has been said by many reviewers on this site, but when a company decides to remove features from a product that many loyal customers have grown accustomed to and repeatedly used year after year in an effort to squeeze out an extra $30 from them, the company has made it clear what it is that they value. Not an economics major by any means, but I do know that a lot of people aren't giving Intuit any money this year, which just might be a good wake up call for them. I had held out hope that Intuit would permanently correct this error in judgement after seeing the uproar they caused, but that doesn't look to be the case. (Didn't really feel like begging someone on the phone for products that should be there in the first place..)

But, I'm told I can buy the unenhanced, gold-plated Premiere version for 40% more than last years download to get exactly the same functionality. This is the second Netflix type blunder Intuit has made. Several years ago they dropped Quicken for the Mac because, as everyone knows, no one uses a Mac and Apple is about to go bankrupt. That worked out well. I used it since the early 90's but one day, they said it's not gong to be compatible with this new fangled Intel based Mac thing. No market there, have a good life (here's Mint). I switched to MoneyDance and could not be happier. When Intuit finally came out with a Mac version a couple years later I have not switched back and won't. So now, thank you Intuit, for helping me switch away from you as my tax software to a different vendor this year, probably TaxAct or H & R Block. One star because there is no half star."

Based on reviews, it's a no brainer to switch to H&R Block this year if you need to file Schedule C (unless your expenses are under $100, come on!!!) or Schedule D at all.

The program didn't offer the option to print and mail the state return. When I had the option of purchasing Turbo Tax, I bought the one that suited my needs based upon the ""selling points"" listed on the columns on the back of the box. This option offered federal and state e-file for the price I paid. There was no indication on the box or at any point during the process that I had to pay another $20 to file. This concept of ""nickel and diming"" consumers is another form of fraud. I know that numerous people have lodged recent complaints against Turbo Tax regarding various software problems and upgrades, etc. I think it's a shame that a product so user-friendly is ruining its reputation over $20. Instead of leaving consumers with a sour taste in their mouth, why don't they just change the price and sell for a set amount and not get the customer tangled up in paying additional funds to file - especially when there's no mention of that anywhere else. It's just bad business and prevents repeat customers. There's a lot of competition out there - this unethical form of business practice is one way to assure Turbo Tax will not have a loyal following and that's too bad."

Now I'm finding that I can't, and that I'll have to do Schedule D manually, and that I can't electronically file if I do these things anyway. Manually filling out the form sort of defeats the purpose of having spent the money for software to ""help"" me. If the business I am in were to remove key aspects of the services we provide arbitrarily at the time our customers need us, we would lose them in record time. This action by Intuit certainly gives me reason to look at competitors - maybe not the outcome they expected with this action, but judging from the posts to this account, it looks like a few others will think that way also.

2145,R2TFQ3OF5IM42Q,"Be careful buying the 2014 Deluxe","I've been using Turbo Tax Deluxe for many years with no problems. Loved it. Now I found out that they have eliminated the Schedule C and D, forcing you to buy the Home and Business edition for $30 more. I have a small part time business and I receive a 1099 MISC for around $5,000 at the end of the year, so now I have to purchase the Home and Business edition. Not sure if this was intentional or just all of the new platforms that have come online. Turbo Tax claims they had no choice, so I will take them at their word. Update: I called TT support and they are sending me the Home and Business edition for the same price as TT Deluxe."
2146,R29FXVR61B0CSM,"Tthis year is slightly misleading and restricted. Not Deluxe.","I am grudgingly giving Turbo Tax three stars. Why? 5 stars for the product itself being awesome. It really does help you get the most money back that you can get. It's very easy to use. it efiles quickly. Feds responded with receiving an HOUR later! State the next day. Hurray! They offer the Amazon matching gift card, which is really handy, since we buy stuff here anyway. That paid for the program easily. -1 star. It says Fed+State+Fed Efile. What is DOESNT say is that to *efile* your State taxes, that'll be another 19.99. Yep. You then have to pay them more. Super misleading product. -1 star. It's pretty basic anymore. I was able to add some very small amounts of income under miscellaneous income (I try and report everything, better safe than sorry), but had I made enough and gotten a 1099 for that income, I would have had to upgrade or use a different product. Really? How the hell is this ""Deluxe"" then if it wont even handle a 1099? Ugh. At least I read the reviews before I bought, so I knew this. But I will still fault them for this, because the complaint is very legit and it is a very bad fault. C'mon, TurboTax! This is BS. If you have basic stuff, like you get a W-2 or two, own a home, drive a car, have some kids, maybe have a few expenses of whatever (job related, some medical expenses, etc), this should do you fine. If you have enough hobby income to warrant a 1099, or you have some stock sales or whatever? This is NOT your product. It used to be in years prior, but not for 2014."
2147,R2AW9XFW3EYESV,"Worst TurboTax Ever","Worst version of TurboTax ever. I've been using TT for 15 years, and this year will definitely be my last. Yes, it eventually got me everything I needed, but it's very clunky to use and very frustrating. If you have to change anything after it's done (which I have to do almost every year), it literally forces you to walk through all of the idiot-prompts in that section step by step, just to change one field - and doesn't even remember all the information you already previously entered; it forces you to re-enter all the information in that section all over again, even if it's not pertinent to the changes you're making. The whole process took at least twice as long as it has in the past, and feels like it was jammed together at the last minute, just to get it out the door; so I feel I can no longer trust Intuit, and will move to a different product next year."

I swore that I was done with Intuit forever; I'd rather file manually then to go along with the higher price of the ""enhanced"" versions for the same features I had always gotten with Deluxe. My review of one star at the time was rejected by Amazon - - I'll admit my anger got the best of me. Happily now I see that Intuit has made good and corrected their marketing fopar. I purchased Deluxe today and immediately received a free upgrade to make it feature neutral with last year's version. A happy customer once again. All's well that ends well.

So today, I tried to call them to get some live support. You will never find a customer service number. You have to process a question online in order for them to give you the coveted number. So, I go through this process, call them and 2 hours later they still have not resolved my issue. Oh, and I forgot to mention, when I first tried to process my taxes in January, TurboTax charged my account $20 for the transmission that never took place! I've used TurboTax every year for about 10 years. This is THE LAST year. Never again. If you're thinking about buying this product, DON'T."

Intuit and their greed finally got me to switch to the competition. Bye, TurboTax... you have changed, and I have not...You became overpriced, you dropped features, you tried to gouge me and use me, and hoped I would stay because of our long relationship. Wrong!

Bob Meighan has rebutted that limited Schedule C is available in Deluxe, but the TurboTax website as of November 15 still says nothing about it -- see for yourself: https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/compare.jsp So, an open letter to Bob: I'm not paying $89-99 for the Home+Business version, and I'm not ""taking your word for it"" on the Deluxe version.

I just found out the Deluxe version I'd always relied on won't let you get this common form - you have to upgrade to the Premiere ($$$) version. I dare you to find that little nugget of information on the packaging. I'm not waiting to find out what surprise up-charges are in store for me next year from Intuit. I'm retuning my unopened version and looking for alternatives. Taxpayers, beware! Look at all your tax forms and make sure they're supported before you buy any version.

That means that I spent over $50 for the purchase of the software disc, plus another $50 for automatic deposits for my refunds. Too much money. Lastly, I tried submitting my state refund and because of a computer glitch or some other lame excuse for international scamming, I was sent an email apologizing for the inconvenience and was offered a $25 rebate on my TurboTax purchase. I found this to be an absolute joke as I entered my info and ID number of my product and was informed that my purchase wasn't eligible for the rebate/payment for inconvenience. What a friggin' joke.

Being a casual computer user I did not foresee the inordinate length of time nor the hurdles encountered in performing my usual tax return WHICH until 2014 had been hassle-free and a piece of cake. I am truly interested and would appreciate a response from TT as to why I had to incorporate this OS update. My tax preparations are complete and have received my first Refund (Thank You), but remaining in the wake of this possibly, unneeded upgrade are some computer performance issues that seem to be related to this OS upgrade.

The true cost of the software is not obvious at first because even the 'delux' version doesn't support basic tax circumstances ... the software WILL force you to throw it away or upgrade to premium, and then you'll get charged again for your state e-file. The name of the game is bait and switch - offer you one purchase price, but take more money as you enter more data into the software. By the time you get to the end, you've already spent hours entering your information and you're ready to quit, so you're that much more likely to pay the extra fees to upgrade or e-file, since this software is pretty much useless without those features.

Having worked in the corporate world for many years, I would imagine that this unfortunate path that Intuit has taken with TurboTax is most likely due to the disastrous input of some newly âacquiredâ corporate executive who was totally focused on increasing immediate profit, instead of retaining patron loyalty. (Ironically, he/she probably got a VERY Big Bonus for gravely damaging this product!) Sadly, the new corporate model of the 21st Century is based entirely upon short-term gain (get in, get it, get out).

(1) The H&R Block software is not a bad choice in computing taxes. However, the download option (from financial intitutions) is much limited. If you have many transactions in trading, TurboTax is still a better choice. (2) Intuit's pricing is a mess. As an example, there are two TTD on Amazon. One is ""Fed+State+Fed Efile"" for $49.97. Another one is ""Fed+Fed Efile"" for $39.99. Yet, as tested with my colleagues, both copies come only with free printed State Filing (both can download on state filing). This make us who paid $49.97 like fool. With this, my rating is not changed. Intuit is no longer a company trustworthy for a long term relationship, regardless what they do now as a temporary touch-up. The typical trend in the software industry is to provide more functions for the same ore less cost. It appears Intuit is going against this trend. This is truly a bad business decision, regardless whether Intuit admits it or not. With a rate so low on Amazon.com, I am surprised to see that the VP of Intuit still expects to garner NEW customers (by providing only free upgrades to returning ones). This tells us something about the wisdom of Intuit's management, and their attitude toward customers. I purchased a CD as I used to do for many years before I found this discussion.

A rep there ended up GIVING me the Premier version which was difficult to download; repeatedly tried to get it installed and finally was successful. When I went to use the state forms, they were locked up even though I was supposed to have free access to one state for filing. Had to contact Intuit AGAIN for help and it was eventually resolved; then had to pay $19.99 to file electronically the state copy.

Somewhere along the line their hat size became very large and they decided the Users were there to be used. So they set up a business model which dumps the user in favor of pure Intuit Turbo Tax GREED. The product is nearly useless unless you go to a more expensive version and then that product still doesn't get your taxes done in many cases.

I've been using TurboTax for over 10 years and loved it for all those years, but depending on what they do next year this may be the last time I use TurboTax.

Well, Bob, if I had any remaining doubts about the weak-brained decision makers at Intuit, you have provided crystal clarity.

The online so-called ""help"" did not address the issue and I waited for an hour to get a call back from customer support. The first call was able to fix that problem (why did it take a call?), but then I encountered another problem trying to download my State return. I waited 2 hours for a call back from the so-called customer service, then was put on hold for another 25 minutes( so far) with no response.

To find that even one stock sale would prevent me from using e-file is more than just disappointing, it's a deal breaker. Intuit has made some fairly egregious customer service gaffes in the past, but this one takes the cake. I'm going to hold my nose and switch to H&R Block software. I'm sorry that since I've already opened the package and installed the TurboTax software I can't get my money back from Amazon. Shame on you Intuit.

It is a tax software package I have used in the past and I have also ran comparisons to see if one or the other resulted in a better refund. They were both the same - within pennies of each other. So while TurboTax may have a slicker user interface it does not, in my opinion, provide any advantage in terms of maximized refund over their primary competition.

I received a SIGNIFICANTLY lower refund ($1,790) than I would have had it processed the data correctly. I called customer service , spent over 2 hours waiting on hold, was switch to two people. The ""customer service"" representative indicated this was a known software issue but since I had filed my return Turbo Tax would file an amended return on my behalf once the software glitch was fixed (which was about an 8 day wait from the time I called). The ""customer service"" representative said he would call me once the software was fixed and let me know how they would file an amended return. INSTEAD of receiving any call, they closed my open call case with the only designation that new software updates were available. I HAVE already filed my return , was given the 100% accuracy guarantee, however, Turbo Tax did not follow through. I would highly recommend you not purchase this software , they do not adhere to the 100% accuracy guarantee. I am extremely disappointed that my loyalty to this product was met with such disdain for my request they back up their 100% accuracy guarantee and the guarantee from their customer service representative that Turbo Tax would file an amended return on my behalf due to THEIR software error.

This charge was never mentioned in their product upfront. I had the choice of not paying and try to mail in my tax return or paying to file online. If I had known about this charge ahead of purchasing TT, I would have gone to a tax accountant which would have charged me $100.00, because that about is what I wound up paying TT.

In the past I have always been able to print my return, look it over for errors on hard copy, and then mail it in. This time, the program would not let me print until I had filed the return electronically. I have used this program for at least 5 or more years and this was the worst experience I have had.

Guess I'll head to H&R. Update: It seems that all is not rosy at H&R either. There's a bug in their software that imports your 2013 return from TurboTax when using Windows XP. I called their customer service and apparently there's no current fix for this and they advised me to type in the data manually. This is where my second issue with TurboTax arose. When I accessed my return using last year's TurboTax, I got a message to say that I needed to update to TurboTax Premier 2013 to access some of the forms. This retro-active crippling of software already bought a year ago is very interesting and another indication of Intuits creative talents.

If you're going to offer a free upgrade, allow it for all Turbo tax deluxe purchasers for 2014 you dimwits."
2249,R2N7JPZ1T4DLJR,"BEWARE...AMAZON GIFT CARD NOT GUARANTEED! CAN BE DECLINED OVER 14 CENTS!","For the past dozen years or so, we have used both TurboTax and TaxCut (now H&R Block) at times. However, over the last few years, we have only been using TurboTax as we had found it to be the best option for us. This year, as we were preparing to make our tax software purchase in late January, we really thought hard about maybe not going with TurboTax given some of the complaints that were occurring at that time. But just as we were deciding, two things happened. First, we learned about the opportunity to get some of our return back in form of an Amazon gift card; second, inuit appeared to be trying to make things right around the issues folks were facing. So we decided to go with TurboTax. We now wish we would have done anything other than that. First, it kept wanting to force me to do my state property tax refund application in order to complete my state income tax return, only the state had not yet communicated everything I needed to do this and these two things are not connected in any way. Eventually, I had to just enter all 0's to get it to process and then as it finally did, I got a notification that the state had not yet completed its property tax application (its not due until the fall), so it was not complete nor eligible to be submitted. Good thing I was forced to complete it and spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to get around it! Second, we live in Minnesota, so as we were finishing our filing, word came down that Minnesota had stopped accepting applications due to fraud issues. So here we were, wondering what was going to happen to our return...in fact, we still are. We have heard that they are now filtering through, but that they anticipate some having to be re-filed. Fingers crossed! Third, we got word that our federal return was completed, accepted, and our refund would be deposited within days. Then we get a communication from intuit on the day of deposit that our funds were now available, but we would not be receiving our Amazon gift card because the IRS had adjusted our refund. So here we are wondering two things...what happened to all these levels of checks that occurred to prevent any discrepancies? And just how much was our return changed to cancel our gift card offer? While we still have no idea about the discrepancy checks, we did get our refund deposited and eagerly checked to see just how much it was affected that we couldn't get our gift card. To our amazement, our refund was reduced by a whopping $.14. To reiterate, that is fourteen cents! Not $14 dollars, not $114 dollars, not even $1.40, but FOURTEEN CENTS! To give some added perspective, our gift card request was less than 20% of our total refund and $.14 would not affect it at all. But apparently, it was enough for them to cancel our order, not explain the discrepancy, and not be available in any reasonable amount of time to respond to our questions. Never again will we use intuit!"
2250,R3PX4BE0N1AVTO,"No State filing included. Liars!","It says that Federal and State are included, but it's a lie. You still need to pay filing for your state return. Scammers! Won't be buying Turbotax this year."
2251,R1XB3TD7U75GCF,"Turbotax Deluxe is WORTHLESS","The Turbotax Deluxe CD I bought is WORTHLESS since it no longer supports Schedule D. And no, I won't pay the $30 surprise ransom demand to upgrade! Time to switch to another vendor with more integrity!"
2252,R17H83A49749J3,"Big Disappointment","I have been using Turbo Tax since the 90's. I am very disappointed that Turbo Tax has become a GREEDY MERCHANT. I always purchased TurboTax Deluxe because that version included Schedule C and I am homeowner. This year since the interest on my home is not enough for itemization I made the decision to use Turbo Tax online (which I discovered wasn't that much of a savings in cost). Although, I was informed that since I did not purchase the software this year I was not eligible for the refund ""quite understanding"" I am still very disappointed with the new Deluxe Version of TurboTax because I convinced many of my friends to purchase it, not knowing it had changed. I hate I did not read the reviews prior to completing my taxes with TurbTax online."
2253,R2TOE66CXVU8Q9,"Intuit missteps in 2014? For sure. But after all the angst: worked fine for me...","...and all I can base my review on is my own experience with the product. Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit. No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing). Three comments about this events: (1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues. (2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count). (3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me. And, I'm happy to report, it worked great. I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages. After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand. I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment. No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined. I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it. However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit). If you're a tax-time procrastinator: April is right around the corner. Now is the time to select with confidence."

They diluted the features while selling it as the same product name and price. To add insult to injury, I've spent hours trying claim the free upgrade as promised by Intuit's blogs, Tweets, and memos on the Mac version. Not a happy customer..."
2256,R1DFPKJXYJKW3E,"Very dissapointed in the changes made for tax year 2015","The feature changes made to turbo tax for tax year 2015 are a measure of corporate greed simply there to drive up revenue. I have used TT deluxe for over 15 years but now I am looking at other options. I hate my business being taken for granted. A few years ago I stored a boat at a local facility and after a few years I got a notice saying the price was going up 50% for all renters. I talked to the owner and he said take it or leave it ,that it was not a price increase it was that I was underpaying before. This is the same thing. Pure greed and unacceptable."

Intuit is a liar and a thief."
2258,R39255S53UG5OU,"Dishonest company","Thank you for all the amazon reviews. I was about to click the BUY button when I read all the horrible reviews regarding how Turbotax trying to squeeze every penny from their loyal customers.

Intuit's removal of Schedule C from the Deluxe version causes you to LOSE ALL SCHEDULE C EXPENSE ITEMIZATION NOTES that you entered in previous years' Deluxe versions, even if you upgrade to Home and Business, unless you then do your taxes in forms mode. In some cases, you won't be able to E-File if you use forms mode. Intuit is the absolute WORST."

2265,RZYXMN895QO7I,"Bye bye TurboTax from a long time customer","Bye Bye Turtotax. I've been a long time Deluxe user since the late 90's. H&R Block made me an offer I couldn't refuse. I got their deluxe tax software for free because I had already purchased TT 2014. I've tried other tax software over the years but was happy with the TT interview style and I've always been concerned about importing my old return into new tax software after a bad experience years ago. For the free H&R Block price it was worth a look to compare the two products. I just finished my taxes for a 2nd time this year with the H&R software. The interview style was very good and included all of the right questions for my situation. No import issues and everything was picked up from last year's TT file. H&R even found an extra deduction TT missed this year. My state income tax refund was reported as taxable in TT but H&R correctly figured it wasn't taxable because we paid Alternate Minimum Tax last year. Easy to use and just as accurate. I've disliked Intuit's business practices for a long time. I'll stick with H&R tax software going forward and I'll dump Quicken Deluxe as soon as a viable alternative comes on the scene. Intuit needs to seriously look at how they treat customers. I'm hoping the lost revenue this year might help redirect their efforts."

I wanted to do Schedule C which I had done previously-nothing complicated. I found I could not even get the form anymore without paying an extra fee of $20 or so. Very frustrating in the middle of your taxes. Also the $15 fee just to file the state taxes is outragious so I just printed it out and filed it with about $1 worth of postage. Turns out theTurbo Tax state returns were hacked anyway and it was recommended that people file the paper form anyway. I have used TurboTax for over 20 years but this may be my last year."
2267,R2DA662HWEXHER,"Last time for Turbotax--what an exploitation.","This is my last time to use Turbotax, after decades of use.

I find tons of similar reviews here that go into greater depth so I won't belabor the point. Do NOT buy TurboTax. Try the alternatives that cover all the necessary schedules."

However, I've often been very disappointed about the ""sloppy"" and imprecise design, and how even if I send in comments, these items are rarely fixed (For example ""Did you receive a refund in the prior year"" -- if you actually previously overpaid but applied it to the current year estimated tax, sometimes the TurboTax ""correct"" answer is ""yes"" and sometimes it is ""no"".). Thus I've previously thought about switching, but was too lazy.... TurboTax's actions this year have given me that push I needed. I've filled in a 2014 ""dummy"" return using TaxAct, and I like it better, and it is much cheaper. So, ""Goodbye, TurboTax"".

Lo and behold I ot a Fed. refund and paid the state 1/2 of what turbo tax said i owed.

I dug into the why's of this and, I found that because they re-aligned their products, I could no longer use this version AND eFile. This imbroglio was apparently due to the step by step feature not being available for Schedules D and E. I use these forms, but do not have a lot of transactions for them. The previous versions did include this functionality. I immediately wrote Bob Meighan, VP, TurboTax, who explained that step by step included some data validation required by the IRS. To use the two schedules in the current version, I would have to use form view which did not have these validations. Therefore no Fed eFile. He did offer and I accepted a free upgrade to Premier. This version works just fine, and based on that, it should be 5 Stars. However, I cannot in good conscience give that rate as I believe this realignment was not well thought out. I can see why so many are steamed about this. TT is a great product, but they shot themselves in the ol' foot this time."

I installed the Amazon Downloader app. Still could not download. (For the sake of this gripe understand that I am in IT support and fix computers\servers etc for a living...been doing it for 20 years so understand that I know my way around a computer). So I started a chat with Amazon support 10 minutes after my purchase and asked for a refund. I bounce to TWO different chat reps and the end result was that I had to contact the Intuit to get a refund. EVEN THOUGH ITS AMAZONS FAULT I CANNOT INSTALL IT. So I contacted intuit. since they are supposed to have a 60 day guarantee. Keep in mind I requested this within an hour of Purchasing the software. and No Dice. So Bad form on Amazon for their crappy download manager, and Bad form on intuit for not responding to my requests. Luckily I found that I can get a free Version of the HR block software which I received within 2 business days... FOR FREE. and I didnt even care about the schedule D switch that Intuit pulled on their up charge.

After reading the back of the product and noticing Schedule C was missing among other parts that I needed, I decided to wait. So that meant in order for me to complete my tax return I was going to have to upgrade to Premium at the minimum and pay about $30-$40 more than I've paid in the past. I dont think so!!!!!Also I decided to Google search this product and I always check the reviews at Amazon before I purchase anything, anywhere. Wow, what a shock.

I will update this review later if I am not happy with it. This is a very bad decision by Intuit. They are not only losing the income from the sales of the TurboTax software but they will also be losing the income for the state tax programs (I buy another state's program) and the e-filing fees which keep getting higher each year. Last two years I had sticker shock from the high cost of the additional state program ($45.00) and all the efiling fees. I have been upset with Intuit for many years for not updating the Quicken software for Mac. It is still stuck at 2007 with only one small paid update to work with the latest Mac OS. I have been searching for another program but when one is used to Quicken the rest don't seem to be as nice. Intuit has tried to write and sell new Quicken Mac software but they still can't get to parity with Windows Quicken. How hard can it be? Well, I have switched tax software and Quicken will be next unless Intuit gets it's act together. I urge everyone who reads this to write to their federal & state legislators to have the government write some great tax software programs that work and won't cost an arm and a leg. It shouldn't cost money to file a tax return especially to do e-file. It seems to me that filing a return by mail is a lot more labor intensive so e-filing should be free.

I know they are offering refunds for desktop users, but us online people are screwed apparently. This really angers me. I don't even have that many expenses to report and am not a business that is making tons of money, so this really cuts. The online filing was convenient, but after this, I probably won't be using TurboTax anymore.

2302,RABFT4ZTO7OZW,"just plain greedy","Ok, 2 stars. Normally I would say 1, but since I read the promise to return the product to what it was before (Deluxe handling K-1 and Sched C) I'll add a second star. That said, I used Turbotax for quite a while now and I already buy the business version (LLC) plus the Deluxe version for my individual returns. I'm kinda ... put off - or let's say - pissed - about the changes to the Deluxe version. It's not so much about money - I used to spend thousands a year on a CPA just to finally figure out he never got the numbers right and cost me a lot more in taxes than I should have paid, so even a price increase wouldn't have upset me. What upsets me is being greedy. I never bought a microsoft product (greedy company), I never bough an Apple product either (another greedy company) and now I'm torn between buying another version of TurboTax for 2015 or evaluating other options. I'll probably explore other options just out of principle. What's even worse is the lobbying of Intuit against simpler tax return filings. Taxes are already a PITA and life would be so much easier without government intervention, lobbying to make life harder for ""usual people"" just to increase shareholder value is something I will have a hard time to ignore on my future choices. So let me put it like this: if I find a desktop product that actually calculates CA state returns correctly - and more importantly in a transparent manner - without me having to spend hours figuring out how to get a from like R-1 filled out - I'm sold. I've filed the same CA return for years, same forms, same everything just different numbers and this year - ooops, some forms missing. Taxes are bad enough for all of us, having a greedy company capitalize on that is a double whammy."
2303,R23PPQU03ALTYG,"Run Far Away From Turbo Tax","I have used Turbo Tax every year since the 1996 tax year. Every year I was more and more impressed. This year they let me down. Intuit got greedy. They decided to make customers buy more deluxe versions than they had to in years past. In previous years, I needed to file a schedule C but would not need to this year. I bought the Deluxe version based on reviews left by other disgruntled customers believing that the basic would not work for me. I had no schedule C income to report, but Turbo Tax tried to force me to file a C and would require an upgrade. I doubt I will ever buy another Intuit problem (program) even though I am happy with Quicken, which I have used for years. When I called to get help with the program, I had to wait an hour for technical support to call me back.I received an e-mail that said I would qualify for a $25 refund. I spent 45 minutes on hold, then was told by customer service that they could not process my refund because I did not buy Turbo Tax directly from them. Since I bought it from Amazon, evidently a mistake, I was placed on hold for another 50 minutes and finally I decided to hang up. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you possess a great deal of tax knowledge. I had to figure out for myself how to get rid of the schedule C it was trying to force me to purchase. I think I deserve a full refund and compensation for the two and a half hours I spent waiting for Turbo Tax to not help me."

I understand, there are going to be updates periodically, but wish each update would be more complete and that they could come less often. I understood, this program could be installed on more than 1 PC. I wanted to have it on my laptop, along with my desktop. This comes with 1 State download of my choice, but when I installed it on my second machine, they wanted to charge me to install the State on my second machine.

After completing my tax return, I went to Turbo Tax to find a phone number to call them on it and get a refund.

I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe. No Schedules C, D, or E. In the past, the product was functional, even though the ""Premier"" version provided more help and guidance. That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it. But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing. So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes. Now in the name of ""consistency"" this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something almost twice as expensive. I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be ""consistent"" and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version. Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money. Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we're supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price. Raising the price is something I would object to but it's just a price increase. It's the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it's not possible to give zero stars. Intuit used to be known for making products that pleased customers and surprised them -- in a positive way. It's sad to see the company's current attitude. **UPDATE -- IT'S EVEN WORSE** OK, I'm angry but I need to do a draft of my taxes for planning purposes prior to year end. So I bit my lip and looked at ordering the Premier version. Even in the high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories. I.e. only good for a tiny hobby business, and maybe not even that. So now having forced me to Premier, even that high priced product is useless to me. Intuit, what is wrong with you people? Everyone who reads this: Maybe you will have to buy the product in order to avoid the trouble of converting to another product. But even if you decide to buy it, please take the time to register a negative review here or at other product review sties. You don't have to write as long a review as I did -- just a couple of sentences and click on 1-star. Even if you have a rational reason for giving in to Intuit's extortion, maybe the negative reviews will cause other customers to choose other products. Maybe someday Intuit will be forced to care about customers. Help other cus"

I was sorely disappointed! Apparently the makers violated the adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" this year, because clearly, a number of changes were made that seriously impeded the software. Why they were made is a mystery, but most commonly these changes are made because someone sees the potential for more profit by changing or short-cutting certain areas. Some expense areas seemed to be incomplete while the income sections were extensive. Three major problems: (1) Software seemed clunky, not as easy to make sense of; (2) On completion I was unable to print a copy for my files, system simply refused to print; and (3) I was unable to forward the completed forms to the government, state or local. The only way this was resolved was a call to TurboTax. It took quite a while, but thanks to the Customer Service Personnel, I was able to compete the task. That said, it is no joy to pay $50 for a product only to find it isn't what one had been promised. Not certain if I will use their service again."

That's like rubbing salt in my wound. I always wondered about TaxCut by H.R. Block. I guess this is the year I get to try it out.

Talk about a total cluster on customer relations. I only fill out a tax return for my elderly Mother because she is required to attache it to her county property tax abatement form. She has no taxable income, so she is not required to file the return with IRS, but needs it for the county form. Now with the changes to TurboTax, if I need to put an amount on a schedule E for my Mom, I have to pay an additional $30 and upgrade. I only put the gross amount of rent on the Schedule E because it makes no difference in regards to taxable income, it is too low.

You folks are lower than a snake's belly. I'M DONE, Intuit. You have no idea how much this kind of gouging annoys me. It's not the cost, it's the DEVIOUS, DECEPTIVE, ANNOYING move. Yeah, I could pay for the upgrade, but I won't give you ba$tards the satisfaction. And I won't be back next year. Enjoy the NOTHING you get from me next year. Taxact, here I come.

I started out with the 2014 Deluxe version, only to find that I couldn't include a single stock sale. Not only that, it wouldn't import from my Quicken 2012 without an upgrade to Quicken! So I decided to manually input my information from Quicken and I upgraded to Premier, only to find that I need to upgrade to Home and Business to include a single Schedule C item! I'm not looking for any features from TurboTax, just a simple tax form! I'm switching to TaxAct, abandoning Quicken for Pwersonal Capital (I've been using Mint - but I'm now against using any Intuit product or service). Way to go Intuit - you've turned a 20 year customer and advocate into an ardent enemy of your products and company."
2352,R14RDDHXAJW1X1,"I love Turbo Tax but I don't like the business practices ...","IMO, the confusion is intended by Intuit. Leaving the everyday and common Form D off of the Deluxe version allows a customer to possibly purchase the product and then when the customer discovers the absence of the form the customer is forced to upgrade to the Premium version or attempt to get a refund that takes weeks to receive. I don't need to guess just what it is that I'm purchasing. I love Turbo Tax but I don't like the business practices of Intuit. I've used Quicken and Turbo Tax for many years but I just purchased HR Block 14 Deluxe for one-half the price of Turbo Tax Premium. I've bought my last upgrade for Quicken Deluxe also. I can use my bank's online software and save myself even more time by not having to duplicate entries and doing downloads. Intuit has lost my business. Again, in my opinion."

But, this year was the worst program put out by intuit. I was very disappointed. We had a difficult time following through the steps and finding the forms, when previous years were a breeze. Deductions were far more difficult. We spent over an hour going back and forth just trying to figure out where we should put our taxes for cars. It wasn't clear. We had quite a large amount of donations. I always love the calculator, but when you can't find the items you donated... what do you do? It doesn't give you the option to do both the calculator and write in the items that they don't supply (which you could then estimate an amount. This would be helpful, as I had to just leave off quite a bit). The wording was confusing... and not just the state and federal guidelines. This was Turbo Tax! The help wasn't even helpful. It stated the obvious, or the definition, but nothing more. Intuit had already issued an apology for leaving out some necessary forms. Clearly there had been mistakes made this year. Those forms were not the only ones... It was a disorganized mess!"

Through the program it solicits you to upgrade right away and charges you $30. Really? I ended up paying $50+$30 instead of $55 buying it outright. No other issues with the software but really feel ripped off."
2358,RZHBM1IWMD6GC,"So, so disappointed!","Yesterday I bought the same TurboTax Deluxe desktop product I have purchased for many years. Last night I read the bad news about Intuit's low key extraction of Schedule D. As a retiree, I am dependent upon my 401K and IRA accounts for income. MRD's can force reinvestment into taxable brokerage accounts pushing me away from Deluxe. Enter the need for Schedule D. This is not uncommon for many in my situation and for many, many more in the years to come. Think about that Intuit. I must now decide whether I want to pay way too much to upgrade for a single need, take the time to return the software, or take H&R up on their offer to receive their product [that meets my needs] at no cost. While I may be a ""minority"" in Intuit's eyes, I have, for many years, been an avid supporter of TurboTax and promoted it among my friends and acquaintances. I now have something else to discuss."

Then too I had to buy the software for preparing the federal and state 1041 s (most people do not have this problem) for another $150-200. The help on the sites was minimal.

This year, after I filed my 2014 tax returns, I realized I had forgotten to include an income item. I logged into TurboTax and generated an Amended Return. However, despite the fact that the program indicated that it would print only the forms required for filing, it printed every single tax form. I sent numerous emails to TurboTax asking for help and received only canned responses that were not helpful. I then tried deleting the Amended Return. I followed the instructions provided by TurboTax and now my originally filed 2014 tax returns are incorrect AND I am unable to generated a new Amended Return. I cannot even see the forms for previous tax years in the ""vault"" as TurboTax won't let me access the vault. I have sent yet another message to TurboTax but I am expecting to receive yet another canned, unhelpful response. I will be researching other tax preparation software options for 2015. Very disappointing since this used to be a great software."

The product is easy to use it is acurate, basically there is nothing wrong with the software. Intuit on the other hand has made me mad for the last time. My issue started with Intuit taking the 1040A form out of its basic package and not clearly communicating this fact. I have always used Basic for my personal taxes and the small bussiness version for my company taxes. So this year I purchased Basic, like I have for the last 21 years, and started my taxes after about an hour into it a message comes up saying that I need to purchase the Deluxe version, traditionally Deluxe just gave you advice on how to create better deductons for the next year something I am not intrested in. So I decide to email Intuit to see if there is some kind of upgrade option since I have already spent $30 on a package that has always previously met my needs. Intuit does not have email or chat contact available they only have phone support. I have used phone support in the past and spent over 3 hours waiting on the phone so I do not consider that as an option.

Two things specifically; my medical costs were well above 10% of my gross income but TT would not use the deduction whereas last year it did? The second point of annoyance was entering gross dividends for my DRIP stocks. After entering in the fields for gross dividends and doing a ""check"" on the return, I had to go back and re-enter the gross dividends on the IRS form which for some reason didn't transfer from the GUI walk through. There were a number of other annoyances mainly due to the miserable instructions accompanying the entry screens.

This the most difficult install I ever experienced. I invested 4 hours on 3 computers, then gave the softwre away only to have it retuned to me by an irate friend who wasted 2 hours trying to install it. I tried at least 10 fixes from on line sources (quite a few had similar failures to install) with no luck. While on tech support hold I drove to the store bought H&R deluxe, installed it and started to complete my taxes while still never hearing a live voice from Intuit.

I won't repeat many of the issues outlined in other reviews. What I will emphasize is two main things. First, this year's bait and switch with Deluxe and Premier is inexcusable, despite the last minute upgrade to Premier offer. De-featuring a software product that has been in market for years is a silly tactic bound to backfire. More annoying, when I had to purchase add-ons, the ecommerce functionality didn't work forcing a call to customer service. It took me 60 minutes to simply pay $24.99 for the state e-file fee (which should be included in any case). While the service reps were very customer friendly, they didn't really seem to know how to help me very quickly.

After training millions of taxpayers to sigh over the high price and then stick with what they were used to, Intuit decided to violate both of those considerations. Imagine the chutzpah it would take to simultaneously cripple your product's functionality and jack its price dramatically higher. Intuit decided to see if they could get away with this, customers revolted, and only then did the company decide they want to ""get our trust back."" Can you think of a single reason to trust Intuit again? Neither can I. We should all place our trust, in the form of our purchasing, in the hands of a more trustworthy competitor.

2403,R1EOHCOUCAFP0G,"Not Great but Better Than the Alternatives","I have used TurboTax on and off for the last 7 years and although it is not perfect, it is better than the other two tax prep packages (H&R Block, TaxCut) that I have used. The user interface is easy to use and displays well as compared to the other two I have tried. The ability to switch to a Forms View is extremely helpful. This is what I use to override the data placement, transposition and calculation errors encountered in the Step by Step View. Do not assume that all calculations are accurate or that the data entered/calculated on one form is transferred accurately to another form. The 2014 tax software performed the worst of any of the TT packages I have used in addition to intuits unpopular decision to reduce the functionality of the Deluxe package. Numbers calculated on one line of a form were transposed incorrectly to another line on the same form and also to a second form that used the number. The bottom line is that you should use TT as a data entry tool that needs to be double checked for accuracy. This requires that you need to read and understand the instructions and purpose of the forms you use. I have also found TT support to be inadequate and minimal. I submitted a number of operational questions on the website, many which never got a response and others that took so long to be answered, that I was able to come up with a solution on my own. On the other hand, their support is not much different than the other Tax software companies. They don't make it easy to make a personal contact if you have a question. When I was able to finally make phone contact with a real person regarding a problem with TT requesting that I pay twice for a second state, the support tech was very good at resolving the problem."

It turns out TurboTax transmitted the fraudulent one earlier on April 9 (I think they provide free 1040EZ returns), and that is the e-file confirmation we were receiving. As to how this could happen, TurboTax could not answer. So the software apparently does not alert the user if one tries to file another return using the same SSN.

2419,R250G6148EFITK,"Fortunately there are alternatives","The end conclusion from the Turbotax fiasco is rightly that those who would otherwise not have tried H & R Block would do so now, and when given the opportunity to compare value, one product may offer a much better value. This year H & R Block Deluxe + State cost me $22.50 (when on sale). And H & R Block has features that are comparable to Turbotax Premier, which costs something like what $75. Plus with TT Premier you need to buy State for another $40. The total cost for TT would then be $115. That would be like 5X the price of H & R Block+State? And if you include the $40, TT up sells for audit protection, which is free with H & R Block (which Dog Dude rightly pointed out), that differential goes to 7X. In the past, I wouldn't have thought of an alternative since I was used to TT. But now, TT, inadvertently let opportunity knock at my door, and helped open my eyes! I know it will likely be the case for others. TT killed the chicken that laid the golden eggs! But things this year will likely get worse for TT for the following reasons: 1) Online users will now specifically check whether their Deluxe version has schedules C, D, E etc., and will be pis*ed that TT did nothing to fix it for online users. Worse, they will be furious that the ball was dropped on them (crippled software) since last year, and that the CEO has not apologized to THEM nor rectified the adverse situation. b) TT will lose all those customers who automatically thought they were entitled to the rebate, but for whatever reason, do not receive it. When was the last time you bought something again from a company when you didn't get a rebate you thought you were entitled to???? c) TT not disclosing their customer service number on their web site will add to customer aggravation especially the older folk. d) Negative reviews on Amazon will pile on since those reading all the existing negative reviews, will already form an opinion, and it certainly won't be positive. e) Turbotax said it needed to make the changes for ""innovation."" Since they are restoring the product, undoing the changes, does this mean they will for future years be releasing a sub standard ""non-innovative"" product, or will they be exposed and laughed at for the ""innovation"" ruse. f) In a Harvard Business School Case, the CEO stated that their motto is ""Delight, don't dilute."" Now by crippling the product, first with the Online version last year, and now with the desktop version this year, didn't they just not dilute by also cripple Turbotax Basic and Deluxe versions. If TT can't even follow its own motto, people will discern that its statements are all shallow or worse, hollow. g) Now that Turbotax is in the spotlight, all its shortcomings will be exposed such as being possibly the only company in the world that uses social security numbers to validate a rebate (and that too for a measly amount that doesn't even compensate for the additional cost of an upgrade). How does a company which should place the maximum focus on security, do something that jeopardizes just that? h) Why did it take 3 long months to offer an auto upgrade? Rumblings about the crippled product began to appear in Nov 2013? i) Why was the apology letter by Sasan G and the initial apology from the CEO (something along the lines of ""we need love"" or whatever) so insincere and with an explanation that insulted the intelligence of MOST? j) Calling a product ""Deluxe"" when it is anything but. Is this what one calls a paradox, or irony? This can go on and on but I think everyone understands why this could end up being a text book business case study."

Intuit and many other consumer product companies know that depending on us for the long haul is simply short sighted. They must move us to items with higher profitability so as to go after more lucrative markets. Look at Intuit's attempts to push their mortgage and other consumer loan products. We are only the contributors to their enormous demographic database. There's not enough profit in us to justify ongoing support. There you have it. Loyalty to the buying public has long since disappeared. Btw, Microsoft has had a published end-of-life cycle for product support on every product they offer from their inception.

To bad it never does So we go through the same steps i've tried a dozen times on my own, I finally get a code so intuit can process my efile, and pay more than the $19.95 i should have been charged. Hello H&R Block. Let's see how you do"

It's Tax Act from now on.","After putting up with Intuit's customer be damned attitude all the way back to Quickbooks in the 80's, I've FINALLY rid myself of this money grubbing company. Sure, having to deal with a new software package was a pain, but not that bad once I got going. Now that it's done, I'M SOOOOOOO GLAD Intuit ticked me off enough to switch to Tax Act. And, forget about paying for California State eFiling. Good ol' Uncle Jerry gave us free online filing.... and my refund arrived the week after I filed."

2450,RXQHIVPATBJ62,"No longer a big fan","Have used TurboTax for many years without incident but this years version (2014) had so many glitches it was unreal. The program was a nightmare when I went to amend an already filed federal return. I had to recheck every line several times to be certain of the correctness. Also when I did the state return the TurboTax program automatically did an amended state return even though it was the initial time I had attempted to do it. I will have to think long and hard about putting my faith in next years product as I was completely disgusted with this one."
2451,R12BE8YFVGKBON,"Greedy Underhanded Company","After using Turbo Tax for many years I was amazed and angered by the recent changes. Not including schedule D is tantamount to crippling the software. I will most likely change over to H and R Block's software in future years."
2452,R2VGJU1AJC7MJV,"With the new pricing structure, I can no longer afford this software.","I have used TurboTax Deluxe for years, and been very happy with it. I'm a Homeowner with some investments and found the (old) versions ability to pull in data from investment brokers and mutual funds very helpful. This functionality is no longer present in the 2014 Deluxe version, and I would be required to pay much more, and purchase the Premier version to have the same functionality. Considering that H&R Block offers software that meets my needs, at a far lower price, I'm going with H&R Block."

Based on changes made to the Deluxe version for the 2014 tax year, I will be changing to H & R's Deluxe version. Bye.... Bye turobtax...

2454,R1GCR7EMNXW1WU,"A shockinglly short sighted decision to cripple the product","After decades of happily filing my returns with TurboTax, I am sad to say the party is over. My wife is self-employed, so having Schedule C is not optional. Such a short-sighted take away, Intuit! Why make a change to the suite of features at this point? Every software company in history that thought that they could gouge their customers with impunity has learned that customers have a way of fighting back. Remember Lotus 123? What about WordPerfect? They held dominant positions in their category until they forgot their customers. Where are they now? There is no explanation for this decision beyond unbridled greed. Good luck with that. Now, I'm off to research competitive products. I'll let you know where I land."
2455,R2BHGM1OD4GXNO,"The Rip off is back!!","I was filing my 2014 return and when I got to schedule C I was forced to update to Home and Business. This after Intuit apologized for sneaking the Schedule C feature out of the program and after I accepted their upgrade to home and Business back in April. Before I started my return (I took and extension) they updated me again and took away schedule C. Obviously they learned customer care from Volkswagen."
2456,R1FE8MQ5HGNVPF,"TurboTax let me down","This year I am very unhappy with deluxe TurboTax. In the past I have used this deluxe program and it included state sales tax. Reading the CD cover, it did not mention that it DID NOT include the state sales tax program. The back could have easily included it where it checked what it did include. Since I had used the Deluxe program many times, I assumed that it did. Now I'll need to pay $20 to get the program. No where on the information I've received from TurboTax and Costco does it say they will update the state sales tax. Updating won't help me and many others who counted on the program to be like it was originally."

After finally being able to get the product to work, I have decided that I will find another product, or go to a real person, for next years tax. What they did with the program I don't know, I got a letter from Amozon stating that there was some kind of rebate available, but even though I met all the requirements (at least as I read the instructions) I didn't qualify, another reason for finding another type of tax service. TurboTax worked well for years, but never again for me. Recommendation: Find another service."
2458,R2I4FMQUOKPG6B,"Another user gone","Add another ten year user to the lost pile. I flat out refuse to pay to upgrade to what I previously had just so I can report one stock sale.

2459,RIEAHJT9QOEAJ,"Once users find out it's easy to switch I think","Bugs everywhere you look. I couldn't efile because it flagged two minor items and then refused any entry to correct them. Okay, raise the price this year with the underhanded redefinition of products, but to do that in the very year you turn out such a sub-par product seems to me to be a recipe to drive your loyal customers to TaxCut. And for me next year, that's what I'll do. Once users find out it's easy to switch I think, more will be inclined to do it."
2460,RD55BZEOUZYZS,"this is the worst and a rip off","no it did not . this software does not let you file schedule E royalties you have to upgrade for a cost of $30.none of the software this year gave you exactly what it contained.I have b een using turbotax for 6 years. this is the worst and a rip off."
2461,R1QMOLCDHHOZDQ,"Switch to H&R Deluxe instead","After years of providing Schedule D and able to import broker transactions and after I purchased the Deluxe version, I found out later that you have to upgrade it to the Premier version to get this functionality. Poor communication to the loyal Turbotax customers. H&R will allow to switch to their Deluxe version for free if you had bought Turbotax Deluxe. The H&R Deluxe version now offers the same functionality regarding broker transactions like Turbotax Deluxe used to."
2462,R10HDOZA3VK6QB,"I hated this year's change in Deluxe","I have been a loyal TurboTax user for years. I hated this year's change in Deluxe, especially removing schedule D, which is very confusing to a loyal customer who have used the same product for years. If TurboTax what to get more money, I would rather they raise the price than changing the product features."
2463,R2014EW0N0VIHH,"Bad experience with Turbotax","It never worked. Following their advice I tried to delete and download again but that was not possible. So I bought H&R Block's program (on a disk!) and that solved my problem. My advice, don't download software. If it doesn't work you are out of luck. I don't see any option for getting a refund either."
2464,R13OOOMUV1IXUS,"Not So Hot...","This version is terrible - I was using TurboTax (Deluxe) since 2009 and this year (2014) it did not import ANY information from my previous returns. Additionally, I understand there is no support for many forms/schedules without upgrading to Premier (for an additional $30). Be aware of these issues if you plan on using the Deluxe version this year - they are well-documented in other reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere."
2465,RMTJ4NY3MTACQ,"Forced to pay $30","Being forced to pay $30 more to get TurboTax Premier because I've sold an investment (stock, bond or mutual fund) during the year? Crazy. I'll be giving the competition a try next year for sure."

If you buy one that doesn't support all you tax needs, you pay through the nose to upgrade online. Last year I bought Turbo Tax deluxe and it was the right product for my situation. This year the price went up. My tax situation was the same this year versus last year. But I had to upgrade to Turbo Tax premier to get the same capability. The online upgrade cost is a lot more than the difference in price if I had bought the right product at the store. Yuck!"

No change in my situation, but they **decide** to automatically upgrade, because they took out features that were included previously. Pathetic.....

This issue for the 2014 tax filing season of this company eliminating forms that have been in the Home & Business edition and the Deluxe edition every year is ridiculous. Then they try and appease everyone with a partial refund to get us onto the ""right"" version of their software and then finally cave in after consumer outrage and do what they should have done in the first place. Thank goodness for the power of the internet to force companies into treating their customers correctly. Too bad your rating on Amazon has now tanked to a measly 1 star, Intuit."

I then got an e-mail from Turbotax saying a lot of customers were upset by this and offered me a $25 refund only to find out when I went to the site on the link that it would not permit me to claim the refund. I was very disappointed with this program this year. It did however work. I just had to mail my return."

You cannot print or establish a password unless you are connected to the internet and go through the Intuit servers. This is only with a Mac, Windows is OK. I find this unacceptable.

I trusted this software to get it right. But their decision to suddenly and quietly REMOVE key parts of this 'magical ability' effectively REMOVED my TRUST that they are a solution to my tax software needs! I will NOT buy this newer, 'dumbed down' version, and will instead migrate to the H&R Block software. Perhaps H&RB will get my NEXT 8 YEARS of business...or more!!"

The two ladies I talked with was able to help me and I was with their help able to resubmit my tax return and got an acceptance from IRS.

2488,R22D168LXE04LM,"It's Not Good Enough to Pay Extra For Schedules C and D.","The prime reason for using TT is that your taxes are complex enough to warrant using the software. That Intuit has decided to go the dirt-bag route is disappointing. I will be reviewing HR Block's offering. Addendum: HR Block is apparently TaxCut....the package I first used prior to going to TT. Addendum2: A brief websearch indicates HR Block will import turbotax files. TT files have a ""tax2013"" extension for 2013...""tax2012"" for 2012, and so on."

Their free upgrade to Premier version was over 4/20, another cheap trick they played. Then I thought I could fill out schedule D manually because I do not have many transactions. I found out that I cannot fill out schedule D even manually. This is a bad company. They always look for a way to gauging customers. Quicken used to let users download transactions from financial instituition. Around 2007, they blocked downloading without purchasing new version. I download my data to the software I own. Why do they ask me to buy another version. Since then, I switched to the free GNUCASH. I will pay for the premier gouging version since I have to finish my tax but this will be the last money Intuit see from me. I will switch to TaxCut or other product next year no matter what they claim to do in 2015."

I am awaiting a credit for the Deluxe purchase as it is not suitable for my purposes, and found the technical representative from Amazon helpful in instructing me how to cancel out my order. Although I found that the credit procedure is very poor from turbo tax- They wanted funds for the replacement well before returning a credit which I understand will take six weeks. My understanding is that Deluxe is substandard to prior years, and the President of turbo tax agrees as he will help off set the added cost of the Premier program up to $ 30 dollars. However, can not even request the $30 credit until I can file my return, which has hit a major glitch that customer service at intuit has yet to resolve. Turns out my free state will not download for free. The additional state I ordered and paid $39.99 for looks like it worked fine."

I already bought and installed the Deluxe software without realizing it did not have the same functionality I had come to expect in the past.

The tax code is complicated, and getting more so - having access to ALL the worksheets and data from the previous year is essential when completing anything but a 1040EZ tax return. This feature did not work for my return, and from comments I've seen from other users of the app with similar problems, I am not alone.

I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years but now I am done with them. Unlike many reviewers that post in December or January I donât review software that I havenât used. I used this software and in the end I wish that I had purchased something else. My review is based on actual experience and not just a review to garner votes by posting early. I had numerous problems and it took me twice as long to do my taxes as it should have. It kept asking the same questions over and over and I filled out the boxes and when that section was completed none of the dollar figures or answered questions showed up as correct. The most glaring was when it asked me if I had prepaid estimated taxes and I answered yes. It then asked me what amounts and I filled in the quarterly payments. When done it did not include those payments in the refund calculation and I had to manually override the data and fix it. This one mistake alone would have cost me $1200. If I had not been watching the refund amount at the top of the screen I might have missed this error. I used the walk me through format as I normally do and this year it was just garbage. It would ask me if a set of circumstances would apply to my return and I would answer no and then it would proceed to ask me 20 to 30 questions to which I have already answered that they did not apply. When I answered yes to a section and answered every question and filled in numbers, when appropriate, it would not use the data or the numbers and I had to go back and fill out the data and numbers again. Very time consuming and frustrating. Ultimately I had no trust in the way this software worked and I rechecked every number and calculation before I filed. Like I said before, one error alone would have cost me $1200. When I was completed it did a scan and it found a mistake, or so it claimed. It told me a number for my 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct. I even looked at the actual printout of my 2013 taxes to verify the number. To make matters worse it truncated the code for the local tax authorities for the county that I live in making it almost impossible to determine what it was even questioning. It stated the taxes paid to INC were wrong when the code is IN C-41. I had to manually go back to the forms and fix the error that really was not a problem and it had no bearing on my 2014 return. A simple waste of time for what it called a data collection form. Doing taxes is not really fun and wasting twice as much time as required makes it really a hassle. Turbo tax has lost a customer that has been loyal for over 20 year back to the days of Turbo Tax coming to you on floppy disks. On top of that, go look at the recent 5 star reviews. Many of them are first time reviewers posting 2 words to one sentence reviews. They use no punctuation and no capital letters. They are fake reviews. How can you trust a company that does that because they are in trouble?"

Turbotax used to be pretty straightforward - now it's deceptive and far from being worth the price. This will be the last year for me."
2509,R2VOK8P88LOUUO,"Not user friendly.","For me Turbo Tax is poorly written and unnecessarily cumbersome. You should be able to highlight any figure on a Turbo Page or on the final IRS form and be taken to a page which shows how this figure was arrived at. I created a duplicate entry on my return (my fault). The software failed to pick it up and I owed the IRS an additional $1500. The FAQ section leaves a lot to be desired."

I paid for the Deluxe and I always got one state download for free. Not only did it cost me to download my state form after I paid for Turbo Tax Deluxe, but they wanted me to pay 19.99 to file electronically. More investment that I expected to pay. I will have to rethink how I will be doing my taxes for next year."
2511,R11IYABHTK7K3M,"good program but if you have state taxes to do ...","the program was okay, but I had to pay so much extra for the state taxes, it would have been cheaper to use an accountant. I had 3 state taxes to do. the program asked if I wanted the first one to be my free one and even though I said yes I had to pay $20. Again, good program but if you have state taxes to do it's cheaper to use someone. The $49 I paid but an additional over $100 was not worth it"
2512,R3QK794A30KZEQ,"Not what it used to be","There was a time when Turbo Tax included everything you needed.

I have used TurboTax for many, many years but was upset with Intuit's removal of forms that have been included in the past so I gave H&R Block a try - never again! The difference in the amount of taxes I owed was amazing and I wonder if I didn't miss something when I was entering information or if there was a problem with the software. Regardless I will stay with TurboTax as long as it does what I need it to do."

I downloaded the Deluxe version from Amazon last year but picked up the CD version this year from Costco. After I got home I noticed that the Deluxe version no longer supports schedule D; the Deluxe version always supported schedule D since I started using it. I planned to return it for a refund and try another application this year. However I found a helpful article at Forbes analyzing this very issue: www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2015/01/09/irate-turbotax-users-can-get-free-upgrades-or-block-substitute/ I want Intuit to succeed and continue to offer great products, so I thought that Iâd call them (800-445-1875) and they did offer to mail me or provide me a download of their Premiere version that does support schedule D at no additional cost. The process took longer than I expected (20 minutes) since I opted for the downloaded version that required me to create an account on TurboTax.com, etc. Although I was initially very annoyed at what appears to be a marketing trick, I am now able to use the same product that Iâve used for decades to prepare my taxes. Hopefully Intuit learns from this mistake... I'll look more carefully next tax season."

2535,RRGGKX83IJPST,"Thanks to those who fought. I'm switching!","To all those who found themselves with a now inadequate version of TurboTax thanks to Intuit's apparent bait-n-switch, and who took the time to write reviews here, I thank you. I too have used TurboTax almost exclusively for 20-25 years. This year, I again came to Amazon to make my purchase and was enlightened by the reviews, resolving to end my relationship with Intuit. Then, in an apparent major change of heart, Intuit offered a $25 refund to all those who had been slighted. So, a major screw-up, followed by a significant 'act of atonement'. Forgive and move on? Well wait a minute! It turns out that to get the refund, you have to provide your social security number to prove you made that purchase. Sounds fair, but ... how does Intuit know my social security number? I certainly never gave it to them. From what I understand, Intuit appears to have been been keeping private information about us. I always buy a desk version. How much of my private information is Intuit keeping without my knowledge and how did they get it? How secure is it? Oh, and that refund? Though more than one version of the program has been crippled, the refund is not for all versions, it seems. I guess purchasers of those other versions didn't make enough of a fuss for Intuit to be sorry. And, about that $25 refund apology .. Did they actually say they wouldn't try the same thing next year? I don't recall that. Anyone else? Competition, I'm in your corner now. If anything above is incorrect and brought to my attention, I will gladly edit this review accordingly, but at this point in time, this is my understanding and without question I'm switching to the competition."
2536,R1YEHQPAB6K6IR,"TurboTax 2014 was a great disappointment","I have been a Turbo Tax customer for upwards of 15 years. This year for some unknown reason Intuit decided to redesign the software and it was difficult to use, hard to figure out, clumsy, and generally far below the quality I have always expected from TurboTax. Next year I expect I will try a competing product. And then this... On Tuesday, April 14 I received an email from Intuit telling me that my refund did not cover my Intuit fees and informing me that $59.98 would be deducted from my checking account to cover the California state filing fee of $19.99 and an additional $39.99 for âTURBOTAX PREMIUM SERVICE: PAY W/REFUND & ANNUAL AUDIT DEFENSE DELUXE.â This is a fee for a service which I did not order and do not want. So I called the number on the email and was told someone would call me back in a few minutes. Three hours later I received a call back and was told that the gentleman that called me couldnât help me. He transferred me to another department where I was left on hold for 97 minutes. When the representative finally came on line, she politely informed me that California state law required them to charge this audit defense fee and that Intuit was simply following the law. I am an executive with an international mergers and acquisition firm and a former CEO of several start ups. I spend a lot of time with lawyers and I immediately suspected that this was nonsense. When I told her this, she put me on hold while she spoke with a supervisor, and when she returned sometime later she told me that I had been informed of the charge after I had completed my transaction. I assume this was meant to be in the fine print. But it was not a matter of California law. Then she offered to refund this fee to me after I paid the $59.99. I agreed to do this on the website and then I advised her that telling a lie about California law to justify Intuitâs actions was probably not a good policy. She then apologized, acknowledged that she had lied, and then she said that she had been instructed to use this line when someone called and questioned the fee. Making this official Intuit policy."

Horrible!","I hardly ever write reviews, but Turbotax made me so angry this year I have to tell everyone what a horrible, horrible program this is. I've used Turbotax for the last 10 years, maybe longer. Every year I go out and buy a CD and do my family taxes and my daughter's and mother's. The program would give me the option to do up to 5 family members. This year I had to go through the website because of the advertised CD problems and because they weren't updated properly and I had to buy a separate license for each person. That really, really ticked me off. Then when I actually started the taxes I had to wade through a very slow, cumbersome program with a lot of faux-friendly, but useless, chatter. Half the time the input fields wouldn't work and if went back to change something, the program crashed. Unlike the CD you can't go look at the actual page on your federal form and make changes, all you can do is go through the interface. If the interface was messed up there was no way to correct it (for instance, it put in a wrong data entry onto the wrong line of a multi line field, making it look like I entered a travel expense twice)It took me days to finish my taxes. Then, I saved the forms. Mine went out fine, but my mother's didn't. So I saved and went in later, hoping to make a change that would allow me to electronically refile, but NOOOOO. Once you log out you lose all access to your forms and you can't change anything, even though it hasn't been filed yet. The online forums were blazing with frustrated people who wanted to go back in before they hit the send button but weren't allowed back in to edit their returns. It was a horrible experience. Next year I'll be overseas and will need to file electronically and it will be HR Block for me."
2540,RP5QNG30QDNCJ,"Used both TurboTax AND H&R Block for 2014","This year I had the opportunity to use both H&R Block software and TurboTax. First I purchased H&R block because I wanted to send a message to Intuit that they should not take their customer base for granted. For years I have wanted an alternative solution to TurboTax because of their nickel and dime strategy and their arrogance. I ended buying TurboTax after struggling with the H&R block 2014 software. With the H&R block software my son (filing as a non-dependent) did not qualify for the American Opportunity Credit but with TurboTax he did. A savings of $1000 using TurboTax!!! On the flip side, TurboTax wanted to use Schedule C for my 1099-MISC even though it was sporadic work. H&R block categorized it ""other income"". A savings of $250 using H&R block. I never was able to get TurboTax to categorize it as ""other income"". Also TurboTax was less flexible with miscellaneous charitable expenses always wanting me to enter mileage when I wanted to just list an charitable expense. Maybe these things could have been worked out with TurboTax but their support is lacking. It was definitely worthwhile for me to purchase both products and compare. Our taxes are not complicated so it was a small inconvenience entering the information separately for both packages. The upside was significant savings by using both and comparing the two results. I give TurboTax two stars because the product is easy to use and has a better interface than H&R Block. They don't get any more than that because they still have a looooong way to go with their pricing strategy, support, customer relations, etc."

Here is the letter Intuit sent out, if you haven't seen it: *********************** We recently tried to explain the changes made to our TurboTax desktop software and apologized for the impact it had on you. Many responded and let us know our apology and rationale were not acceptable.

Beginning February 7, 2015, you can buy the same product you'd normally buy, and if you need to upgrade for your tax situation, we'll help you do that at no additional cost.

By the time you are ready to prepare and file your taxes next year, the TurboTax desktop product you trusted in the past will include the forms you've counted on for years.

It is hilarious they are blaming the change on needing to align the desktop functionality with the online and mobile versions of TurboTax. Bottom line is Intuit removed functionality from the Deluxe product that has been there for double digit years. Same price for less functionality is an unusual software model... Intuit, you have damaged your relationship with your long term customers, face it. Saying that it only impacts a small percentage of your customers, just 10 million or so, is lame. I'm betting this will have long term ripple effects with current customers and future potential customers that will now avoid you. By taking the steps you did, you have lost the trust of customers.

Bob Meighan's offer for a free upgrade to Premier was tempting, but just for kicks I checked out H&R Block Deluxe to see how it compared.

Someone had stolen her identity and filed a bogus return. I had purchased the state efile and couldn't use it. Intuit never did refund the cost of the state efile. Furthermore - Intuit could recite to me all previous tax years information, since I have used Turbo tax for several years, which I find concerning. Intuit is holding all your information regardless of which production is purchased, on-line, software, etc. Do yourself a favor and run a quick search on Intuit systems being compromised and you'll find a several complaints. After doing research last year I found an interesting Intuit email test. A person ran an email test in an attempt to determine if their email servers were compromised. His tests resulted in a great likelihood they were. Iâm not overly thrilled that Intuit hold all our information and ""tryâs"" to protect it via the use of firewalls and other security techniques because it simply isn't effective. I assumed efiling was just a clearing house for the simple process of efiling and the information was not being held in any vendorâs core network. Iâve worked in Cryptology and the old saying states, âwhat man secures can eventually be unsecuredâ. Do a quick general search on security breaches and youâll find several hundred. I can't determine where the ""leak"" occurred and my spouses information was compromised however there are very few places where all this particular information (full name, SSN, employer, etc) would have been available. Intuit, since they hold all our information, may be the source however I donât have enough proof and/or facts to make a case. What I would suggest is to purchase tax software. Load it to a clean machine and update it with the most current forms. Disconnect it from the net and start your taxes normally, putting your personal information within the software. Do not reconnect it to the net until youâve removed the software and your personal information. Print your returns and snail mail them to the taxing authority. This way the vendor of the tax software cannot possibly keep your information within their core network servers/databases and helps prevent your information from being compromised."

2561,RSCY2JKSW02GV,"Loved it but left it","Loved it but left it! I have purchased TurboTax for many, many years [although not from Amazon]. and have recommended it to quite a few friends and associates. For most of that time, the product has been very solid and easy and efficient to use. Although my tax situation has not changed substantially, the price of the TurboTax product that I now need to buy to complete my taxes has nearly doubled, because Intuit has emasculated the functionality of their product that I have used for years. You can read any number of other reviews here to learn what product functionality has been removed. Can I afford the new price? That's not the point. The point is that - unlike a few years ago - there are now other very robust software alternatives at much more reasonable prices from companies that do not price gouge, as it appears that Intuit is doing. I have previewed TaxAct which is PC Magazine's Editor's Choice. I am convinced that it is as capable and intuitive as TurboTax and I plan to purchase and use it in the future. So although I have loved TurboTax, I will join what appears to be a fairly sizable market share that is leaving the Intuit ranks."

Last year I took our taxes, as completed by myself on Turbo Tax, to H & R Block for a free review wherein H & R advertised they would be able to ""save us money'. They were shocked and I was totally satisfied, when I walked out of there after being told that they couldn't find a thing that I had missed.

It didn't take long for me to read that it was time to finally change brands. Over the years, Intuit has been a pain with various Quicken/Quickbooks version issues (I HATED being forced to upgrade in the 90s), but I'd almost forgot about those wars when this came up.

This software does NOT give you the opportunity to declare anything outside of the Big Six ""allowable"" reasons (or the 14 or so secondary situations) -- and NO, even the ""had health insurance plan issues"" doesn't give you a place to input ""federal and state foot-dragging"" ... so, you're kind of stuck, there. Also, if you really NEED the refund, and are willing to pay the ridiculous non-compliance fees (which is pretty galling, but definitely a temptation when you're un-employed), it appears that you need to file WITHOUT any of the Hardship forms. This, however, is not possible, even if you click AWAY from attempting to have any Hardship applied -- the Hardship forms *still* get created (and, no, the people at the 800# were NO HELP.) Oh, yes -- before I forget: the Tax Specialists that you supposedly are paying for with the DELUXE (and above) iterations seem to NOT exist. I've called to try to get one on the phone, but am *always* kicked into the ""we'll call you back"" queue. Each time I have done this, I got my ""call back"" many hours later -- and AFTER the Tax Specialists had already gone home for the day! Nice touch, to have a general employee call me, read aloud from my account the note that I need a Tax Specialist, look at her watch, realize that she just wasted a call (because it was after-hours), and apologize all over herself. This has happened twice. On my third attempt, the ""call back"" never came. So, no, I can't say that I would recommend this for anybody who doesn't fit the ""cookie cutter"" Osama-Care mold."

I will check other options for next year."

I wrote them with their form letter response to say, ""Too little, too late. I've opted to H&R instead this year"". Whoever made the poor decisions at Intuit ought to be fired. A fine product and they got piggy. The alternate I mentioned, well, has some good things about it, but I still preferred the format old TurboTax used to have. The only thing I can state otherwise is that this alternate product brought attention to me of a real estate tax credit for seniors in MO I was never made aware of with TurboTax in the past...and this literally saved my 86 year old mother on a fixed income with a $1100 real estate tax rebate off her state taxes. Not that I love this other product, I just wish TurboTax kept up with what was a winning product, improved upon it to justify additional cost, rather than fall flat on their face with such inept decisions at whatever level that deserves the criticism."

Upon buying the product for $40 USD, I realized that I need to complete taxes for two states and an additional non-residence form. With this software, I could only complete the taxes for one state. To complete it for another state, I need to pay another $25. However, with the $25, I would still not be able to submit the non-residence form. Instead I had to go figure where the form is and than complete it myself. To complete the form myself and e-file, I had to redo my federal and states taxes online via efile and than pay $25 to efile. Hence, I decided to just complete my taxes via efile (which was only slightly more complex than turbo tax anyways) and just pay $25 to efile. In the end, I did not use turbo tax to file my taxes. The $40 did not make my taxes easier and could not help me solve the complex issues of my taxes anyways. In the end I did it myself and the $40 was wasted. A refund in this scenario would be much appreciated."

First, my state wouldn't open. This was after Turbo Tax supposedly fixed the state issue. I kept trying every day, and about 3 weeks later, it finally opened. Same thing with Its Deductible. I wanted to use it for the estimate feature. It wouldn't open, so again I kept trying and about a month later it finally worked. Each time I tried to open State of Its Deductible, Turbo Tax would freeze, so I would have to shut down, and to reopen, Turbo Tax would have to restore my file. Also, I had to forego a small credit, because I would have had to upgrade to the next level of Turbo Tax A(formerly part of Deluxe). Even though Deluxe said I could upgrade for free, the software would not allow me to do it. My tax situation is relatively simple, and it should have allowed me to complete my taxes in an hour or two. I had to start over many times. I had no problem e-fling the Federal return. When I tried to e-file the State return, I got a message stating that my tax situation would not allow me to e-file, and I would have to print the return and file manually. Turbo Tax did not explain the reason. So for the first time in 9 years, I was forced to file the state return manually. This was very frustrating. I never previously had issues like this with Turbo Tax. If I don't feel reassured that 2015 has been fixed, I might look at other programs next year."

This resulted in me paying hundreds of dollars more than necessary to the IRS. The 1040X (amended tax return) form was painful and ultimately just wrong using Turbo Tax. On-line instructions how to file the 1040X using Turbo Tax were poor saying in general to do different steps, but not telling how to do that using Turbo Tax. I eventually figured it out, but the 1040X form Turbo Tax printed out was filled out incorrectly, sections of the form directed not to be filled out for my case were filled out. I had to manually fill out the forms from IRS.gov. I specifically buy Turbo Tax so I don't have to do that. I called the Turbo Tax help line in mid February.

2613,R1GUXJL7FC6LGN,"INTUIT DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCT - NO GUARANTEES","I have used Turbo Tax for years, back when it came on floppy disks. I enjoyed the ease of use and never had an issue. HOWEVER...last year (2013 tax year) I used it for taxes, just like normal. I took money out of my retirement fund when moving from a job, and entered it in when TT asked me. Everything looked good, submitted the return and got a check a few weeks later. In December 2014 I got a letter from Maine Revenue Services. Scared, I opened the letter to see that I had been audited, and my return had a mathematical error! I thought ""no way, I used TT and it always has all types of advertisement that math errors are double checked..ect.."" I pulled the 1040 from my cabinet and sure enough, the program MADE A MATH ERROR, to the tune of $900ish. I thought I must be doing something wrong so I took my return to HR Block and they went through it. Yes, TT had made a math error. The program skipped over line 19 (or whatever line it was) and did not add it to the total for taxable income. ARGH. Maine gave me 30 days to pay out the error, with interest and penalties. I had to cough up $572 on the spot...due to a math error from Turbo Tax. HERE IS THE WORST PART - and the reason I felt compelled to write the review. I contacted Intuit and asked for help before I paid the IRS. They did not respond. I waited until the deadline for payment and ended up paying the IRS to prevent further issues. I re-contacted Intuit and sent me an email a month later saying ""Dear Mr. xxxxx, We do apologize for the delay in processing your claim. We are moving as quickly as possible to process all claims but are a little behind. We cannot provide a specific date by which your determination will be made but we will complete our analysis and provide your resolution just as soon as we can."" Wow, thanks. This was January 31. Sent a third email...STILL NO RESPONSE. NEVER again will I use this program. I went to TaxAct online and did it for free. NO ISSUES. NO $$$. So much for the ""accuracy guarantee"""
2614,R3AGTFMNI5FXXS,"Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 price gouging","We have been using Turbo Tax (""TT"") since 1998. We do have a small business requiring Sch C and investment in stocks. In the past the TT Deluxe version had always been adequate to handle our return. In 2014, we had very few stock transactions and the small business was winding down. However, when we did our return (using TT Deluxe), it forced us to upgrade to Premier when we tried to input the sale of 3 stocks; as we were half-way done with the return plus our long history with TT, we obliged and paid an additional $30 to upgrade. We then proceeded to enter information for our small business, TT lets you enter some of the information, but half way in the process, it prompts you to upgrade to ""Home & Business"" for another $10! If anything, our 2014 return is much simpler than prior yearsâ. In prior years we had pages upon pages of stock sales; we had home-office deduction, depreciation, ... for the small business; and we were able to do the return on the Deluxe version! But this year we are forced to upgrade upon another upgrade to complete the return. Businesses succeed in improving their products to reward existing customers and to attract new customers. Whoever at TT thought of this tactic to increase revenue should be fired! We would not use TT again!! Turbo Tax you have lost a 17 year loyal customer!"

There is no way to print a clean copy of the return until after the final version of the tax forms are released in Ohio, that means Mid to end of Feb. If you are using the program to do your taxes and to get a nice clean print out for any legal reason such as Bankruptcy or divorce proceedings - You are in trouble, as it will print with several watermarks all over it, proclaiming it is not a valid form. EVEN IF THE SUB-FORM IT IS WAITING ON, IS NOT ONE YOU ARE USING. AArrgghhh! Yelling at Customer Service does no good. THIS IS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW. I took it to the VP in charge of the program at Intuit with no satisfaction. There needs to be a way to over-ride when you need that clean copy for some reason.

This appears to no longer be available - at least I couldn't find it. So for the first time in at least 15 years I had to use Excel to create my detail sheets and then copy the number into TT. But the REAL problem came when I got to the part where I needed to claim my tax credit for a solar array. TT does not have the state forms for those, which I can understand. You can't have every form for every state. So I followed the instructions, found the form on the state website, printed it, printed the entire NC State tax return, mailed it, everything OK. I even got my refund. But Turbo Tax still has my return flagged as having an error.

After being a very satisfied customer of over 20 years, I will be looking elsewhere for the 2015 tax years to see what other software is available.

However, after I read several reviews and was reminded of the fact that I had to make the annoying choice to upgrade to a more expensive version of Turbotax to fill out schedules D (dividends and capital gains) and schedule C (business expenses). Many reviewers are very harsh about this years version and the required upgrades because they claim Intuit's primary motivation is to raise the price of the fully featured product they actually need. I'm not super happy about it either, I think it cost me an extra $30 or $40 on top of the price of the Deluxe version. I can certainly feel some displeasure for this unanticipated expense. However, I don't think the price changes constitute usury. Ultimately the question is, does TurboTax offer enough to me for the extra price? Given the ease of use for myself to communicate my taxes with my CPA I feel I can justify it. I'm not saying I like it, nor is that the correct choice for everyone; I'm only saying that I'm willing to tolerate it. but just barely. While deprecating schedule C & D from the Deluxe product, may be a bit shady. I would strongly recommend using a CPA for anyone filing a schedule C anyway, which could eliminate the need for this software in the first place. In my case, my CPA reviews my TurboTax files as a basis to suggests various changes and to save money.

Unfortunately, I spent about 45 minutes putting in personal information and W2 information, only to discover that I was required to purchase something. Having a 1099-OID form requires me to purchase a $35 Deluxe Service. I didn't think that was too bad, and I'd already invested the time, so I agreed and continued. Once I got to filling out form 1099-B, they informed me that I would have to purchase the $55 Premier Service. By this time I was frustrated, gave up and decided to take it to H&R block, which ended up being cheaper. Again, the service would be much more honest if they would just let you know how much you're required to pay from the get-go.

2667,R3785VUJ1YWVWT,"THE EPITOME OF GREED","I have used TurboTax software for years but after this years fiasco where they removed features from the Deluxe package I always bought and then charged an additional $30 or more dollars for a Premium version without any notice, I jumped ship to H&R Block software. The interface is slightly different from TT but in less than a couple of minutes I understood it and was able to being my return. The software is straightforward and does everything TT does without exception. It has the same error and issue checking capabilities and does make recommendations throughout the process. I was able to easily import my 2013 information from my TT file without any manual editing required. That was a big plus. It easily auto-imported our W-2 data and saved a lot of manual entry. I had all my other data ready to go and it was super easy to add all my other financial data. The whole process was very seamless and I'm not going back to TT. Besides the ease-of-use, I saved 50% on what I had been paying for the same features and capabilities of TT. Thanks H&R Block. I like the fact that I have phone or chat support if I need it. Everything went so smooth. Filing your taxes is not fun, but I can unequivocally say that using H&R Block software made this process the most hassle free tax preparation experience I've ever had. Furthermore, I did not feel like I was getting ripped off buying this software."

Based on these year's changes to the product and the reviews it has received on Amazon, I'll be exploring other alternatives. Update - January 14, 2015: After making a request a few days earlier, I received a code from H & R Block for a free download of their software. It downloaded and installed without a hitch and imported my TurboTax data without any problems. I'll be writing a review of that software once I have had an opportunity to check it out. I was not eager to use another product after using TurboTax for more years than I can remember, but I just don't feel that Intuit values its long-term customers. I've had a similar experience with Quicken which I have used for many years and it has bugs that I have never been able resolve. Despite that, they demand a new purchase upgrade every three years.

Of course somehow they found a way to screw me in the end when it clearly says, ""+ State"" in the title, yet wanted $20 to eFile it!!!!!

The first time this came up, I spoke with an accountant about this and was told this was not considered income as it is paid to the resident state. Turbo Tax should pick this up each year but does not. There are other areas that are no clear also. I also don't like the fact that I cannot change the adddress of the charitable contribution. It still shows the address to Good Will in the state where I lived 5 years ago and I'm not able to change just the address.

The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that it seems the company has deliberately made it difficult to file state taxes by mail. Last year I couldn't figure out how to get around paying their $19.99 fee for state tax, so I paid to file online. This year I went to a discussion group on Turbo Tax and found out how to print and file by mail. My other complaint is the well discussed change to the lower priced versions that eliminated some options and forced users into a higher priced version. Turbo Tax realized its PR blunder and made amends. However, wanna bet that next year's revised version won't come at a higher basic price? I thought not. A pox upon thee, Turbo Tax!

Further, the information we had last year it would not download it either. I had to write everything all over again. This years Turbo Tax was a total mistake in me buying it. I should have asked for my money back period. All I know is that Intuit lost a repeat customer for next year.

I've been singing the praises of Turbotax every year (for 20yrs) to anyone who asks and will listen to me extoll its virtues, but this year was so horrendous I will look elsewhere next year, no exceptions! First, the software denied my FREE upgrade to Home and Business after that whole debacle about taking business expenses out of the Deluxe version (nice try you jokers). This was on April 14th mind you...I don't pay Uncle Sam until the last minute as the gov't aren't getting more of an interest free loan of my hard earned money unitl the 15th. An hour later and that was finally resolved by phone support (phone, really!! this isn't the 90's anymore, how about a sotware app that actually works and has online or chat support, even crappy Comcast support can use chat). If that wasn't bad enough, then on the 15th (tonight!!) at 6pm EST the program refused to load the payment page for the state return and forced me to yet gain call support. (In their defense I did actually get a call back w/in an hour and considering its April 15th that's rather amazing, kudos to their phone reps for having to support this junk).

Turbotax state NJ does not deduct 18% of your rent (if you rent your home) as a property tax payment, as allowed by NJ tax code. So, at 4.2% overall income tax rate, the loss over 5 years, for me, is over $1200. Nice job turbotax. I've tried to contact them about this to no avail. Honestly, I have long suspected that their state products were fundamentally subpar. Now I have the proof. Yes, I could refile, but doing so would take hours and require me to reassemble every single form required for paper submission."

I to add insult to injury Citizens Bank charged me $20 for issuing the check. Consequently, my $99 dollar was converted to $19.02.

I've always liked the products, enough to put up with a relatively high-level of irritation over previous corporate money grabbing decisions and poor customer service. For example, several years ago Intuit started forcing everyone to upgrade Quicken on a regular basis or lose downloading functionality. I came to Amazon today to purchase TurboTax Deluxe (as I do every year), but will likely go ahead and buy H&R Block's product. I don't have the time to deal with these sorts of repeated stunts. It is also the only way I can send a message to Intuit, ie through my pocketbook.

I was told I could get a $25 refund if I had used Deluxe version last year, but needed Premier this year. I paid $20 more just to get a couple of schdules that have always been included on Deluxe. I didn't qualify for the $25 refund because I didn't file our own taxes, even though I still purchased and used both versions.

I am thinking I'm victim of identity theft and it has me worried. So I called Intuit customer support in regards to this thinking maybe it may be a software error. Got a hold of a customer support representative who was polite but told me this is an IRS issue and that I need to check with them. He sent me the number to the IRS identity theft. I spent the past 2 hours trying to get a hold of the IRS. Of course every time I called I was promptly disconnected after a few minutes telling me due to the high volume they cannot connect me. Finally after about a dozen tries I was able to get on hold and got an IRS agent after waiting for about 15 minutes. The IRS agent checked all the social security numbers including myself, my wife's, and child to see if anyone had use the number to file. So to my relief someone had not used my SSN to file. So it was back to TurboTax. After getting hold of an Intuit customer representative and spending about 40 minutes on the phone with them they said they cannot do anything for me and to try filing using their online site or just mailing it in. Not only was I out the 40 bucks I spent on this software and another 25 bucks attempting to file my state also. My state efile did not go through since I was unable to file my federal.

Also, the Deluxe version always included a Schedule C, however this year they decided to omit it. So when I got to the home business part of my taxes it told me I needed to upgrade and pay an additional $40 to get the forms I needed.

I put in my families information in and right away leveled a penalty for not having insurance on myself and my college age child whom I was claiming. It gave the option to input a waiver # provided by the IRS. At this point I decided to go no further and investigated the internet and the Turbo Tax forums to see how to go about applying for a waiver. After much research I found on the forum that there is an option for asking for a waiver due to insurance costing too much through my husbands job. I filled out that part of the program and it took the penalty off my taxes. I have no idea how Turbo Tax will verify my information via the IRS because it didn't explain how that part of the process works. After I finished my taxes but before submitting them to the IRS, I always go through them one last time looking for any mistakes I might have made or if I forgot anything. This year every single time I did that the above healthcare waiver was deleted and I had to do it all over again. Thank goodness I was paying attention or I would have submitted without the waiver that I researched so much. Since I utilize Turbo Tax to the fullest by doing the whole families taxes I ran into another problem doing my dad's taxes. This was the first year that it did not find last years taxes from my computer. I deleted it and started over again. The second go around it found his last years taxes but only transferred his name and address. Everything else was working from a blank slate. When I finally finished his taxes it deleted everything I had just worked on.

I find even deluxe was not the right program but need to upgrade to TT Premier. The last year Basic 2013 is now what Premier 2014 is. I didn't see any difference except that the price went up from 29.95 to a whooper 79.95 for 2014 Premier not counting the cost of Deluxe 2014 that now is of no use.

This year, TurboTax decided to ""default"" to a paper check refund for the state; why, I have NO idea - but I was frankly VERY annoyed!

I was on the phone 20 minutes more today trying to get the refund of 19.99 that was supposed to post to my credit card yesterday, a week after I filed. I now have to wait 2-3 weeks to see if it posts. If State is not included in TurboTax products in 2016, I will use another service."

I have been using TurboTax for years but due to a computer crash I lost the 2013 version. Now I have to download 2013 again from Amazon and reload it so that I can get the upgrade that shouldn't be needed in the first place. This is after spending time trying to figure out what was going wrong and then dealing with Turbotax not being able to connect to the Internet though I was able to get on to everyone else's site without a problem. Thanks to the people at Intuit that have wasted an awful lot of my time, a terrible review is the least I can do to return the favor. BTW... Intuit is offering a $25 rebate to try to correct for their sins. Problem is the needed upgrade cost $30 (assuming you can get the stupid program to recognize your Internet connection) so it still costs you more. They should be paying us and firing everyone responsible for this stupid move. Update: Got Intuit to upgrade to Premier with the help of an Amazon (Thanks Amazon!) so I could enter a Sch K-1. Got to the very next section and found that you can no longer enter a Sch C with either the Deluxe or the Premier Editions and that there is another $10 charge to ""upgrade"" to do so. Well Intuit, I think as little of you as you think of your customers - of which I will never be one again."

Intuit quickly back peddled to allow investment income in Deluxe. But what will happen next year? The price of Turbo Tax has risen nearly every year I've used it. I already pay the government enough in taxes. The $54.99 for Turbo Tax Deluxe is basically just another tax, except that I'm paying it to Intuit rather than to the IRS."

The only issue I have is with the State portion, page 4 of Georgia Form 500 does not show up when you Save or Print, and the only way you can get it to appear is by going into Form Mode. It has been this way since I started using it and continues even this year. I speak with TurboTax each year and they Dont fix it, they just tell me to go into Form Mode and I can see it there. I would hope at some point they would fix this issue as its a pain to deal with, year after year."

I was supposed to get one state filing free according to the advertisement, but that did not (surprise!) include the electronic filing of the forms. $20 more dollars to me. I trusted the program. Dumb me. I had to file two amended returns."

In the meantime I bought H&R Block Deluxe. It was OK but as soon as Turbotax straightened out Deluxe I bought it and used it. I hope they learned a lesson and don't try to nickel and dime long time customers again. Save your money and buy another program. They dropped Schedule D from the Deluxe version which many unsuspecting buyers will not discover until they have made a mistake and bought it assuming it is just an update of the 2013 program. Turbotax's brilliant idea of making buyers pay for the Premier version to get Schedule D is one of the more stupid decisions they have made."

I usually file my taxes in February, but I still don't have my state taxes filed because of this error, and I'm running out of time.

It guides you through step-by-step, and checks everything for you so there's no mistakes. I was a little disappointed in the 2014 section for charitable contributions. I remember last year it helped you value items donate charities like Good Will. I found I had to come up with my own values this year and probably under valued many things, as I remember being surprised in previous years how much was recommended for some items. I was also disappointed that when listing these items, you could not use ""various"" dates when you have donated to the same organization several times throughout the year. That was a choice as you are entering, but when you did your final review, it came up as an error and told you ""various"" was no longer allowed, so I had to go back and separated out each group of things donated on a specific date. Good thing I keep good records! All that said, I still love Turbo Tax and wouldn't dream of using any other method."

Every year I have been able to enter a small amount ($4,500) of rental income. I have no expenses associated with this income, no management participation, no fees, no nothing. All there is is the $4,500. There's no reason I should have been forced to upgrade."

I then E-filed again and for the second the form was rejected.. TurboTax did not tell me where the second error was located so I refiled it and once again was rejected.

The IRS naturally wants people to e-file -- it saves the IRS from having to use OCR to scan paper forms, a labor-intensive and error-prone process. Now, some filers will soldier on using Deluxe, manually completing forms for Schedule C, D, and/or E. They will be forced to file by postal mail and will be a major pain to IRS offices that have to input all this data. The IRS will have to devote more resources just to handle the same amount of information. Mistakes will be made, returns garbled, correspondence triggered, refunds delayed. Your taxes and mine pay for that. This situation adds another layer of irony to the TT saga, the company that lobbied the government to not (I repeat, not) simplify the tax filing process.

Not sure what they expected, but if I raised my prices by that amount in my business I'd have no clients left...my hunch is that TurboTax has lost a slew of loyal customers. They'll likely come to their senses for next year, but if I like H&R Block's product enough, I'll just stick with it.

A product that would handle our tax situation relatively painlessly. If the product was changed it should have been called something else. The stupidity of Intuits leadership is amazing!

They no longer provide a free state efile; the verbiage on the package attempts to make customers think that the efile is still free. Also, they now charge $39.95 for a second state. This eliminates any savings whatsoever, as one could purchase the federal/state for the same price. To me not being deceptive is huge.

It will even import you TT info from last year. I'm also replacing Quicken which I've used for 20 years.

I read your VP's responses. Yes, after taking additional time to download and pay for the upgrades, I could take more time and call Intuit and talk to one of your support people. However, if you have any chance of retaining me as a customer (I also purchase Quicken and QuickBooks every year), you may want to consider just automatically crediting my account for the amount I paid for the upgrades. Please do the same for any other customer who has paid for the upgrades. You have created a publicity nightmare for yourselves and a gesture of goodwill would be appreciated."

This year the child dependent care credit was not working so I spent a large amount of time with them on the phone and they did not resolve the issue. They then continued to send me multiple emails saying the ""Case is Closed"" and wanting me to fill out surveys about my experience. After about a couple of weeks with no resolve, I went to Best Buy and bought H & R Block's Premium software. They price-matched Amazon and I was able to finish my returns swiftly. My only complaint with H & R Block was they could not import my E*Trade account easily, so I had to figure that out myself - but it is probably better for me to learn that in the long run anyway. I would recommend H & R Block this year over Turbo Tax, maybe next year Turbo Tax will be better. I am disappointed in their customer service since I have bought their product many times before."

Now they have made a greed play far beyond the pale that is beyond comprehension. Even with the capitulating this year, they are making no bones about sticking it to us next year and beyond. That is not why I'm writing. I'm writing to warn about Tax Act. They are turning out to be just as devious. The very first step in TaxAct is to import a previous PDF to fill in your basic info. This does not even try to import before stating: The TaxAct pdf import function is down for maintenance. It has been like this for the entire ten days since I wasted $25 on their software.

Mr. Meighan, VP, TurboTax, has stated (on 01/31/2015 - as a response to other highly dissatisfied (ex-) customers) that for next year, they promise to restore the software (versions) to their previous functionality. The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. If they do restore TT Deluxe, for example, but decide to charge more that $50US, then I highly doubt I will be returning as a customer.

All I got was ""programming"" language and from I figured I needed Adobe to accomplish publishing by tax return--so I bough it at a cost to me of approx $168.00.

After years of investment, my tax return got complicated but it still covered all my need. Every year, as usual, I picked up one from Costco without paying attention to what was not included, because I believe it should look after the need of most of the tax payers. I did the same a week ago. This morning I happened to come across a few negative reviews on Best buy. Further research on Amazon confirms it is true. There are 393 negative reviews (1 star). Only 55 reviews have 5 stars. People are complaining the exclusion of all the schedules which are commonly needed by those who invest in fund and stock through IRA, 401K etc. This reminds me the similiar thing happened a few years back when Turbo-tax prevented people from installing the software in more than one computer. Even though, they may change their mind next year because of the drop in sale, there is no guarantee they will not think of something more outrageous in future. One thing I can think of is to prevent other software to access the data you created last year. By that time, it will be too late to quit. Since there are other choices in the market so It is about time to look elsewhere. BYE."

And their reviews are well justified. The company pulled a fast one by not including functionality for Schedules C and D in the ""Deluxe"" version we have been buying all these years. Like many, I got my copy and found this out. So my choice was to incur expense to return it or upgrade. Here is what I did--I called the company and got (amazingly) an English speaking human. I was just looking for the most convenient way to return what I had purchased and go to H&R Block. He was very nice and properly apologetic for what had happened. He said when they rolled out the 2014 software, they got over 13,000 complaints almost instantly from customers. In the ensuing conversation, he saw that I have been a Turbotax customer for over 15 years and upgraded me at no cost. I give him 5 stars as a representative, but I still give Turbotax the company only 2 (again, I would give them one star but my review would not be read). Two additional points, fellow complainers: 1. The representative said that it you want full Schedule C AND D functionality, you can't just buy the ""Premier"" version--you have to go up to the next level (""Home and Business""?) 2. Reading the reviews for H&R Block, I found that their lower cost version still does include Schedules C and D, BUT they have a problem getting the program to load under Windows XP, even though the box says it is XP compatible. They have known about it for several months but have not yet fixed the problem (as of January 25)."

The Deluxe version in anything but deluxe... it looks like it was designed by a former airline employee. "" your deluxe seat only allows you on the airplane ...it you want to sit down that's 20.00 extra..if you want a seat cushion ..another 10.00..on and on..

The import of my W2 was not possible and I, like many others reported the error. The support site I was given seemed indifferent at best and by the time the problem was fixed I had manually entered my data and e-filed. Now some might believe that importing a W2 is not critical or important but I believe it is key to having a correct return and an important feature. It is after all part of what I paid for and didn't get. To me, no matter how wonderfully a car drives it doesn't matter if you can't get it started. I am particularly sensitive when a company has worked out how to collect my money but not how to deliver what I've paid for and after getting my money, seems disinterested in my report that their product is broken. After the manual entry of my W2, the product performed well. However I waited about a week and a half for a fix and finally just entered my own data. Only afterward, when I had already filed my taxes, did they report this problem was fixed. Not soon enough in my estimation. Every day I opened the product I was notified of updates but never a fix. As a customer that paid for certain advertised functionality, I had to wonder how this bug was not important enough to warrant a immediate solution patch? If I wanted to do my taxes manually I would not need to buy the software. I'm sorry if this seems harsh but I was not happy with the process and telling me its fixed weeks later when I've already done my taxes does not help me as a customer."

2944,R2DTCM6YYWK3LZ,Disturbing,"This year's version of Turbotax was disturbing. When Sasan Goodarzi, General Manager of Intuit Turbo Tax, had sent out an email describing a fix and apology due to a wholesale revamp of Turbotax software that apparently forced many to upgrade in order to utilize forms that had previously always been included I was astounded! I hadn't even ordered the software yet so I was rather reluctant to do so. I waited until after the promised fix date of February 7th so hopefully I wouldn't run into problems. Then, it didn't help that in latter weeks many states were refusing to accept tax returns transmitted by TurboTax because of fraud didn't exactly give any encouragement that my return was not going to be affected. Not what I had expected from a company I had trusted for nearly two decades. I was alarmed at the reviews I saw here on Amazon regarding this years TurboTax release. We, as customers, thrive on continuity, and rely upon a company's integrity to deliver a consistent product. To make wholesale changes in software solely to increase profit after so many years of reliable consistency was deplorable. It is one thing to improve upon and build functionality into a product for the benefit of users and another to take away functionality in hopes the faithful will expend more funds so as to enjoy what had been previously provided. I hope that next year I don't receive another email from TurboTax stating they're fixing something that shouldn't have needed to be fixed."

This year's version of the TurboTax Deluxe does not allow to file electronically a tax return with the Schedule D. Removing features from a product just to force customers to buy an upgrade, what an extreme arrogance. It is time to look for alternatives."

I expected much quicker for paying that amount. When calling TurboTax customer care, with all due respect, it was a fiasco. Their customer service program stinks!"

I purchase it on Amazon in December without even thinking about it, only to find out that the Deluxe package won't do schedule D - to do that I need to upgrade to the ""Home & Business"" version. Earth to Intuit, Earth to Intuit: What exactly does ""Deluxe"" mean, please explain? Why do I need to purchase a business tax package just because I had a capital gain that requires schedule D? That is such a blatant middle finger to your customers that it leaves me wondering how a company could be so stupid. Anybody remember the copy protection debacle several years ago when Intuit tried to keep people from installing TurboTax on multiple computers? They made such a mess with that bone-head decision that they eventually reversed course and removed the copy protection the following year so people could actually use the software they had legally purchased. But not before they lost a lot of customers. Apparently Intuit does not learn from their past mistakes - or maybe they have such a huge piece of the tax software market that they figure they can do whatever they want. Which is why I won't even bother calling their 800 number to get the ""free"" upgrade to Home & Business this year - I just got my free copy of H&R Block Deluxe."

2970,R61DWYEFR8J6E,"Turbo Tax Screwees.....there is salvation in HR Block software","This is an update to my review of a couple of months ago. I ran into a problem with Turbo Tax for 2014 even before I found out about the missing forms. Intuit upped the system requirements for Mac users such that the software was no longer compatible with OS 10.6.8, which happens to be the last version of the Mac OS that older software designed for the power pc chips can be used with. I was not about to upgrade to a later OS and then have to buy hundreds of $$ of other software. So, TT 2014 would not even load onto my computer. And if I had been able to load it, I would had the same issues about missing Sched D. After receiving the Intuit gobble-de-gook emails that went from 'we miss communicated' to 'oh oh, we got caught,' I found out that I could download the HR Block software that did everything that I needed and worked on OS 10.6.8 FOR FREE that was being offered to Turbo Tax purchasers that had been screwed. HR Block was smart to jump on Intuit's monumental screw up - sure to become a Harvard Biz School case study. I am here to say that the HR Block software worked just fine. It imported all of my TT data and actually was a little more detailed in its treatment of a broader range of tax issues & forms (which took a little time to get understand). And to buy the HR Block software would have cost much less than TT. So, guess what? I will be buying HR Block software for 2015. Many of the features and design are quite similar to TT. A TT user will have no problems using the HR Block software. A kudo to Costco. I bought my TT 2014 there in Dec and then took it with me to CA for the winter without having tried to load it onto any computer. I returned TT 2014 to Costco in CA and got a full refund without the original receipt. Apparently, they were able to tell from the bar code. The gal at the returns desk said that they were being deluged with returned TT 2014. By the way, I filed electronically a couple of weeks ago and the Fed refund is already in my bank account."

From that interview and disclosure of needs from the client, the proper version of Turbo Tax would be recommended. This allows the client to choose the correct item UPFRONT instead of getting most or all of the way through the return prep and then learning an upgrade is necessary at an additional charge? Taxes are very complex, and relying on a generalized outline of functionality in the product description page is quite a gamble for the consumer. Personally I don't want to be required to have a level of tax knowledge in order to know exactly what I need before I even start!

I shouldn't need to check the feature list to see if it has been crippled to gouge more money. I don't expect to be charged 80% more for an upgrade to fill out basic forms. I have been a loyal customer since the first release of TurboTax. Last year was the first time I had to use an accountant for my taxes to handle complexities, but I came right back to TurboTax this year. With nothing to import, I had to start the program fresh, and this was not a good experience. It was constantly trying to sell me add-on services. TurboTax did not even request basic critical information from my previous return - I had to enter last year's tax manually on the appropriate form to prevent an underpayment penalty. All the while it was trumpeting how it was doing such a great job of finding every deduction and error. A hollow promise lined with greed. Then the last straw, it refused to allow me to file Schedules D and required an upgrade. I couldn't even access the forms manually. In all of their products Intuit seems to be concentrating on how to charge you more rather than improving products and performance. Not only that, they actively lobby against taxpayers at the federal level (opposing free filing for example) and have been accused of willfully allowing fraudulent returns to boost their revenue. See the Wikipedia article about TurboTax for more details. I have no desire to support this kind of activity. After researching alternatives and reviews, H&R Block Deluxe + State is less expensive than TurboTax and gets excellent reviews. It also directly imports your TurboTax file, so there is little pain to switch. I wish I had known this and switched before starting my return this year."

I thought this would be a simple matter of uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Each time I attempted this the reinstall reverted back to Home & Business. Finally after searching on TurboTax's website I found a solution that involved manually uninstalling the software and deleting directories. I started my return and made it all the way to the state portion and attempted to download my state. This was a big headache as each time I tried to download it the software would tell me I was up to date but would not download my state software. Again I turned to TurboTax's website and found this is a known bug when you upgrade your software from one version to another. They created a tool to fix this issue and after running it I was able to download my state and finish my return. Intuit & TurboTax - for as many people as you have that use your software, you NEED to make sure it works, and works well. It's slipshod design when your uninstall doesn't really uninstall but basically leaves all the files on my hard-drive and just deletes the shortcut. Based on the poor design of your program this year and all the other headaches of moving features from one version to another I believe next year I'll turn to another tax software to file my returns.

I'm in general pleased with the product. I find the web version and the PC version offer similar capabilities. The biggest things I like about TurboTax is how well it loads data from Quicken, and how it integrates with itsDeductible.com. I remember when TurboTax didn't play nice with Quicken a few years ago, and I'm pleased to say those problems no longer occur. The biggest thing I don't like is that TurboTax Deluxe dropped all support for Schedule D this year. It moved to Premium, which costs more. There was a very large brew-ha-ha over it, and Intuit finally gave away Schedule D support this year. I don't have a lot of stock transactions, but it is silly to spend double the cost for just a few transactions. That would have sent me to a new tax software this year. I don't expect Intuit to give Schedule D away next year, but it would be very nice if they included a limited number of transactions, say 5, in the Deluxe product before forcing you to the Premium product in 2016."

I also had to keep restarting the program because for some reason when I tried to transmit the return it kept giving me an error message. I restarted the system 4 times before it finally let me transmit the return. Last thing, during the process of trying to pay by credit card the price of the state filing fee changed from $24.00 to $19.99 and back to $24.00 so I know there must be major problems with the software system. Sadly this may be the last time I use this software unless they can assure me the bugs will be fixed next year.

I kept the preparer at $400/year till we sold the house and I moved to another state. Now I've moved back to first state and decided I didn't need a $400 prep for my lifestyle.The $50-ish for Turbo Tax Deluxe makes it easy. You pay extra for a 2nd state's return (at about $50 more as I recall), but it's reasonable and practical.

The questions they asked got me through my taxes in one evening because I had everything together to check in paper to be sure I wasn't missing anything. They asked appropriate questions that I didn't even think about & even our tax accountant last year missed to increase our refund a small amount more than we expected this year. We paid over $120 for an accountant through our homeowners/car insurance company & it took much longer & I felt like she didn't grasp everything or ask enough questions to be sure she or we weren't missing anything...which is why we got Turbo Tax this year & did it ourselves. This program, especially the Deluxe one for Deductions & Homeowners, isn't for accountants or people who run a business of any kind ( even if its part time)....If you are an accountant, there are professional software programs meant for you to get into detail without asking questions because you know the tax codes & wording better than people who need the help. If I want running a small business, I think I would shell out the money to pay an accountant because any mess up can cause an audit & lose you more money than its worth to do it yourself.

Anyhow, frustrated I decided to pull the trigger and buy TurboTax. If nothing else, to do some check and balance. TT came through for me as it always has done plus saved me a few thousand dollars where TaxAct fell short. Also I find the TT UI is much easier to use and navigate compared to TaxAct. I bought this from Amazon as an instant download: -Download and install was flawless. -Download of the State portion was flawless. -As soon as I hit the Schedule C area the program instantly prompted me for a free upgrade to Home and Business edition.

Twice I have learned that you have not yet fixed your software, but have promised a fix by March 6th. I read on the help page that this is a problem experienced by many users. Somebody at your company surely screwed-up this year, first with excluding items that had been included before, and now having a non-working piece of software. Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased your buggy software!!"

The program would not accept the information I was putting in. I have used Turbo Tax for as far back as I can remember and I am very loyal. When I buy a program I expect better customer support. I spoke to someone from Quicken support and she said that the programs are only set for the normal tax payer and if you do something out of the norm it won't accept and you have to talk to someone. That is nice, but how do you do that when no one will respond. I was only trying to do a married couple filing separate with one taking all the deductions. No matter what I did it kept saying you cannot do that. Really, if I was doing it manually I could."

TaxACT), but I usually find it worth the premium to guide me through important life changes like a spouse passing away, purchasing a home, what to do about having some 1099-MISC income, and misc. investments. This year, the product costs the same as the 2013 version but cannot prepare Schedules D or E. This change wasn't exactly presented clearly by Intuit. Because I can't return opened software, I'm going to use TaxACT for a fraction of the price of TurboTax Premier or Home and Business. Thanks for driving me to your competitors, TurboTax."

Turbo tax failed me this year. Each update sent me in different directions completely. State Tax forms standard version, were either inaccessible, costly ($45 for access), or simply not there. Each time after an update, it was necessary to access every page as to what was still entered and what was not making it more laborous. A postcard from Costco advised of a free update/upgrade to the Deluxe version but that did not happen EVER. I finally hit a state of spending way too much time and Efiled simply to get done. However, I realized later that there was $0 refund from state -- each and every year I've received a a refund of $690+/- making this year's effort frustrating.

You can't file the return without getting the latest updates, but you can't get the updates. I spent more time on the phone with customer service (multiple times and multiple tickets opened) than I spent completing my taxes. And there customer service was terrible. They would not resolve my problem (after hours on the phone), they would tell me they were going to have the next level support contact me, then the next day I would get an email that the ticket was closed.

There were a few questions that I had to go to the internet to ask because the built in ""help"" isn't always that good. But I eventually got there. My biggest complaint was the efiling, specifically for state. My first efile for state was $19.99. About a week later, I did my mother's taxes. At the end, I tried to efile and the cost showed up as $19.99. While trying to pay for it, there were errors over and over, and it wouldn't let me purchase the state efile. I had to close Turbo Tax and open it again. Again, I walked through the efile section and I had to purchase the state efile right, yet again. This time the price had gone up to $24.99. I'd already paid for the software, did the taxes, and even purchased one efile at what I expected to pay! I'm not going to deal with the hassel of mailing documents, and I would have been ok with the $24.99 price had it not increased for who knows what reason in the middle of me trying to buy the right. After purchasing the right to efile for $24.99, everything went through without a hitch. I wasn't frustrated enough to complain, but another feature of turbotax is that they like to email you constantly and the last one I got was bugging me to post a review. Well, here it is. After all the shenanigans this year, I will probably look to one of their competitors next year. I just can't see shelling out $60 for the software, $20 to efile, and another $25 to efile again when their competitors will import my turbotax records and give me the same experience at much less cost. If you take anything away from my review -- watch the cost of your efile. Seems like the closer it gets to April 15th, the more expensive it is to user their software."

They deleted the ability to download 1099 forms from Investment firms so I had to buy TurboTax premier to do that, but before I installed it, they restored the ability to download these forms. The cycling was a pain in the but and cost me several trips to the post office to buy and return CDs that I thought I needed or didn't need, all to do what I had been doing for years with the Deluxe version. I like the software but TurboTax needs to quit gouging its customers, both on cost and products. I suspect there will be quite a large number of ex-TurboTax customers either this year or next.

I complained about this in last year's review. When entering items, the list is very specific. I have donated lots of extraneous items that fit nowhere on the list.

But, what the heck, I need to file and it is still cheaper than hiring an accountant. But what a way to erode goodwill. Now, the company rep replies below that I can go to a website and get at least $25 back. Well, I put in the required information (including my ssn--ouch!) and they cannot determine if I qualify. They give me a number to call so that I can wait on the phone until the cows come home. Thanks a lot. Next year I am going to check out the product of a competitor.

I tried multiple times and called multiple times. Twice I was on hold for over 2 hours and never spoke with a rep. Next year I plan on using a different software and I will recommend that to anyone who asks. That is terrible customer service and beyond my tolerance level.

After spending a lot of time on TT website I learned that they had screwed this up too and I had to download a fix and start over. What would I have done if I had not discovered this innocuous fix? They knew who I was and that I would have this problem, but they never notified me. So I am into this thing about 3 hours before I can even start my taxes. At this point I have lost all faith in TT and have purchased HR Block on Amazon. I simply don't trust TT to handle my taxes anymore (for the first time since 1995, and I still have all the floppies). Hope that some of you other victims can recover from this debacle, but I would advise caution."

After I filed I went to the link to get the $25.00 and after filling in my info got a message that they had no information to issue the credit, but had a number to call if you were having problems. I called the number and got a message that if you were calling about the rebate you would have to call after April 20th.

Considering tax season is just beginning, Intuit hasn't even started to see the worst of the backlash. This is going to get ugly. This has to be one of the biggest corporate product screw ups I've ever seen. You had the best product and a legion of folks willing to re up year after year. Now you are basically begging your long time loyal customers like me to leave by removing form D from TT Deluxe. Goodbye TurboTax.

I wanted to e-file because I was getting a refund and it is much quicker to e-file and you get your refund quicker as well. A few years ago I could buy the Federal tax program for something like $29.99. Adding the state to federal program of course costs more, but it seems to me that if you're going to charge $59.95, you could throw in the e-file for the State as well."

Sometimes continually trying to improve something leads you down the wrong road. Pretty sure that's what happened with this year's version.

Unfortunately, I just got to the investment income section and it is time for the free upgrade to Premier, I kept receiving an error message. Turbotax gave me a message to call 800-268-8957 to get an upgrade code to enter which would enable me to upgrade. This is where it gets worse because after listening to a recorded message which covered both the free upgrade and the $25 refund for those who already purchased Premier, I have been on hold listening to some crappy Muzak for 30 minutes (so far!) with no other option. At this point I'm not sure if anyone will ever answer the phone to help me upgrade. So now I'm stuck in the middle of filing my taxes with no recourse but to sit on the phone hoping someone from Intuit picks up. So, all in all, a horrible experience that seems to very uncommon! It's a shame."

Suggested that I upgrade to Intuit 2015, which I did only to find out that It did not include Bill Pay. So I called Bill Pay service in the US only to be told ""That is not my problem, I would have to contact the software customer service which he had no phone number that he could provide to me"".

I really did not want to change but when you crippled the product this year in the name of consistency (please), I finally reached the tipping point and switched to H&R Block - and it was easy. A very similar experience. You'll find that when you lose customers, it's very hard to win them back - much, much harder than keeping them satisfied. You play a similar game with the quicken product when you disable network downloads after a few years to force customers to repurchase the same product to maintain existing functionality. I guess when you get to the point of doing that every year, I'll have to explore my options on that product as well."

The 1 thing I am NOT happy about this year is that there is some issue with the State Refund and I e-filed early this year and still in March 2015 have not received my refund so I'm not thrilled with that and noone has bothered emailing us to let us know when to expect it."

Several attempts at TurboTax support did not help. I finally input the numbers my self manually on blank forms. Not pleased with it this year!!! Don't know if I'll use it again. For a little more than the price of this, I can have a professional prepare my taxes and not worry about needing ""Technical Support""!"

After completing my Federal returns I was told by Support that their product could not do my State Part-Time Resident return and I needed to complete it by hand. After efiling my Federal, I dumped H & R Block and purchased the tried and true Turbo Tax. Started from scratch and it was able to complete my Federal and State returns much more quickly AND gave me a better return on my Federal side. Needless to say, I amended my returns using Turbo Tax. I will be returning to using Turbo Tax once more as it proved faster and more thorough. I regret my decision to switch."

I ran into a problem when adding my 1090s for myself and husband but soon solved the problem and found I was not checking the new 1090 box and going to the other person option. It is easier than going to have your taxes done by a professional who would also just key in information that you provide. Since your info is the only source to prepare taxes, why would you just feed that info to a pro when you can get the same assistance from TurboTax. Good program and my taxes came back in 1 week."

I had to buy the Premium version due to having a rental property and this has always been included in the past in Deluxe. I just noticed there was a refund available but instead of doing the right thing Intuit has decided to put an expiration date on this refund. Why should there be an expiration date when they have gouged the consumer? Very frustrated...called support and when I asked the tough questions they ended up hanging up on me.

Intuit should had been more pro active and put out the correct version to start. I realize there is a rush to market on these products, however it should not be done at the expense of the consumer."

I also didn't know you get charged an additional $35 fee for state filing on top of the $24. I'm sure it's in the fine print but the way the product is marketed is a little deceitful.

I think this was roughly the same price and it was so convenient to download and begin my taxes without having to make a trip out. I'm always happy with the walk through instructions from Turbo but you can easily skip sections that are not pertinent. If you've never used Tubo Tax, you will appreciate the fact that it profiles your personal and employment info from your prior year and will prompt questions such as ""Did you pay ABC Child Care again this year?"". Taxes are never fun, but Turbo Tax makes the process bearable."

It helps you gather your information by walking you through very specific questions, which you can answer in each very doable stage of the whole process. Later since it has kept all of the necessary details together for you, it can easily compile the results for each separate section, in order to give you the maximum benefit allowable by law. It definitely takes all of the mystery and alot of the stress, out of tax time. I would highly recommend it."

3168,R1DF6C6AJDN4QU,"Turbo Tax Squeezing its Customers","I was very disappointed that Turbo Tax limited the product by requiring me to have to update from the Basic program that I have used for years. In fact, even the Deluxe was limited. I was pressured to upgrade for an additional $30 which I refused to do. I was able to finagle the forms so as to reproduce what I needed. My return is not that complicated. I will be looking for alternatives next year or I will go back and hand-complete the forms like we all used to do."
3169,R23OQL8F8A3AY8,"Last time for e-filing for me","This is the last time I'll be using this to file my taxes online. The fees are ridiculous. Not only do you purchase the software, they also charge a fee to transmit the state tax return ($24.99), PLUS another handling-type of fee of around $40. So, add on another $65 or so to the cost of the software if you're planning on filing electronically. Filing online is convenient, but I'd much rather have those extra fees in my own bank account, thanks. Otherwise, it's very easy to use and I do like how it pulls info from the previous year's Turbo Tax filing. It also asks about possible changes that may have occurred during the previous year - marriage, moving expenses for a new job, etc. - but it's easy to skip those if nothing has changed. Much faster than filling out the forms by hand, but, again, not pleased with the extra fees that aren't mentioned until the very end of going through the filing process."

I have used TurboTax for the past twelve years, but next year I will be using another company's software."

I have used it for several years, but while it says free e- filing, at the of the program you are trapped, tricked into using their email and it costs an additional $50.00.

3172,RR5PZMNI9UV4D,"Print version","I have been using Turbo Tax for many years, but this year's version was bad. My major complaint is that I could not print the final version from a different computer as I placed the final version on a zip drive and hoped when I got to the office I could print it. When I called your help desk I got a automated voice that did not answer my question. Then as per instructions, I emailed the IRS for a hard copy and so far have not received one. This was a little over a month ago."

It was wonderfully easy last year,and advocated using Turbo to friends.This year it took over 6 hours ,even using a phone representative to file very minimal deductions. The program froze and wouldn't efile . I was told to check with a computer expert to service my compuetr,which I did and was told nothing was wrong with the computer. Going back to the Turbo,on phone representative who advocated the help of her supervisor, we plowed through and finally was able to email the tax forms to Feds and state. No one seems to be able to indicate what the problem was ,other than that the some additional forms were new/different this year all which I didn't need to use ,i.e the one for stock revenue and the one for rentals. Since I didn't use these ,I am not sure how this affected my filing."

Running the numbers through Turbo Tax, it asked more questions over the area I figured the other should have. In the end, Turbo Tax said I was owed more than twice what H&R Block had calculated. H&R does offer a return policy, but it's not worth my time for the amount I purchased it for. I will be sticking with Turbo Tax for next years taxes as well. Hopefully they don't pull any stupid stuff like the last time."

3176,R3HMYQROXWOSUP,"Excellent, Easy To Use Tax Prepartion Software","I've used Turbo Tax for several years and have always found it makes income tax preparation much, much easier than trying to work my way through the forms without its guidance.

I've never had a problem with any of my Turbo Tax returns, and a couple of years ago was able to save a friend much work and expense in using my software to spot a very large error made by one of the well known tax preparation companies.

This year, however, I discovered an large error in the Pennsylvania State return which I had to override. I withdrew large sums from my retirement account at work (401K) for rollover and other investments. TurboTax treated these withdraws as state income leaving me with a large tax bill. PA does not tax retirement income from qualified plans if you are over 59.5 years and retired."
3178,R57UJDUH505YG,"It's not the Turbotax that it once was","It's not the Turbotax that it once was. The question-and-answer walk-through is relatively simple, the program also checks to see if you would do better itemizing or taking the standard deduction another plus. Although I may have overlooked it I would like to see a feature for a married couple to show you the difference between filing married joint versus married individual. On the negative side - once you get down to printing your return either to file or for review Intuit gets so busy trying to sell you their other products that it makes finalizing your tax return aggravating. Up until this year I have been very pleased with Turbotax and felt that it was worth a slightly higher price, next year when I'm ready to do my 2015 tax return I may have to rethink this."

It is so easy because you do not have to input all your personal information each year.

They double check everything and tell you if there are any errors to be fixed. They also give you an idea of how likely your form will be audited.We will continue to use the product in future years. You can efile both federal and state, but have to pay extra for state. That would be the only negative for me."

I receive a phone number and Incident ID#.

I bought a competing product online. When I tried to use the competing software early in April, it wouldn't function properly. I called their customer support and they tried to help me, but it looked like it would take quite a while to troubleshoot the issue. I therefore asked for a refund and took another look at TurboTax. I had received an email from Intuit stating that they (finally) realized that customers were not accepting their rationale for the changes in TurboTax, and that they would provide free upgrades as needed for full functionality. I decided to give them another chance, and bought the 2014 tax year TurboTax here on Amazon. I downloaded it, it updated itself, and I started my taxes. It imported my information from previous years, and I did the various entries needed for my particular situation. When I got to items requiring upgrades it automatically prompted me to do the upgrades, downloaded and installed them in minutes, and I was able to proceed without delay.

I was going to take advantage of that option until I dug into the terms. The third party bank that was handling the transaction would be able to market to me (I hate all the advertising being forced upon us these days) and would have more access to my information than I felt comfortable with (mainly an uneasy feeling regarding security of my data) so I canceled the gift card option.

The NC state portion was fully automated - but every past year I got a $50 refund and, without me changing my status, this year I owed $150. Do I blame TurboTax or do I thank our Wingnut Ideologues in the state legislature who lowered business taxes and paid for it from the great unwashed majority of everyday citizens??? (Oh, and 90% of the business give away money went to 3 of NC's 100 counties . . . if you checked to insure the Gov's home county got a 'fair' share, the answer would be ""You bet, it was more than 'fair'!!)"
3273,R1YO13JSHU7J2D,"Intuit Finally Got It Right -- Sort Of","DESCRIPTION: After reading that TTax Deluxe had finally (and belatedly) restored its former functionality, I decided to give it a try. At first it seemed to be OK, even though one of our returns had a Schedule C (imported from last year's TTax Deluxe, which did everything we needed). This year's TTax Deluxe asked for the associated 1099-Misc (Schedule C) information, but, to my consternation, it never presented a menu for business deductions. So, not surprisingly, when I ran the Federal Review, the program discovered eleven errors, and when I asked TTax to correct them, it took me to various forms and asked for information to be entered there directly. No ""step-by-step"" was available at that point. Apparently the dumbed-down version was still operating. I then ran the Federal Review again, and the return passed the test. But when I went back to take a second look at the Schedule C information, TTax indicated that an upgrade to ""Home and Business"" was needed. I elected that option, and the upgrade was applied gratis. At that point, however, TTax indicated that many of previously-completed sections of the return needed to be reviewed. I went through all of those sections, and there was nothing wrong with any of them, so it's unclear to me why they needed to be reviewed. ANALYSIS: Once Intuit acknowledged that complaints about the dumbing down of TTax Deluxe were justified, the company should simply have restored the missing forms to the Deluxe version. Instead, they relied on user savvy to request the necessary upgrade, and the upgrade didn't apply seamlessly; instead, it introduced further complexities. I can well imagine that many people were flummoxed by Intuit's method of restoring previous functionality to TTax Deluxe. According to the Welcome screen, I'm now running TTax Home and Business, not Deluxe. BOTTOM LINE: So, I'm left with a couple of questions. (1) Will next year's TTax Deluxe include the forms that were eliminated this year? (2) If the answer to (1) is affirmative, will tax data from ""higher"" versions of TTax (Premier, Home and Business) import seamlessly into Deluxe next year, so I won't have to go through various user-initiated steps in order to get the Deluxe version to work without further hassles?"

3298,R2BUP0D3ZMCB55,"The software works, but Intuit created more trust issues this year","I've followed the thread started by M in SC for the past 4+ months. I've even posted a few comments. And now I just finished my own taxes. Tax year 2014 is finally closed. By now, the controversy about crippling Deluxe and the multiple bungled responses from Intuit have been discussed to death. I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said in some of the thousands of comments. I hope Intuit fixes this for tax year 2015 and the lesson sticks for future years. This isn't the first time Intuit has tried to pull a fast one on customers and been caught. There was a TT controversy a few years ago about printing additional tax returns. And Quicken/Quickbooks - the file format changes with every new version, so once you upgrade you can't go back and you become a slave to whatever mandatory bundled services come with the new version. And every upgrade seems to have more required services bundled in. One good one - with Quickbooks, the Intuit self-service payroll service is only good for three years. If you're a Quickbooks customer and you use Quickbooks for payroll, even self-serve payroll - you must upgrade to the new version every 3 years to keep getting payroll updates. But this review is for Turbotax Deluxe, not all the other Intuit products. And for me, overall, it worked. I called the toll free number early and Intuit gave me a free upgrade to Premier, so I was able to deal with my Schedule E and Schedule K1. That worked. The installation went smoothly, the interviews asked all the right questions and, near as I can tell, all the forms looked good. I e-filed my federal taxes and US Mailed my state taxes. A text message came to my cell phone a few hours after e-filing that it was received, so the process was smooth. If I have to install TT on some other computer in the future and do something with my 2014 taxes, that will be a problem - but it's unlikely. And I have PDFs of all the forms. Finally, there's Turbotax VP Bob Meighan. Bob has been the public point man through all this and he's taken a great deal of abuse. Kudos to Bob for staying engaged and mixing it up, even in hostile territory. So overall - the software did its job and was easy to install and use. Bob Meighan is a visible spokesperson and he gives the best answers he can give, at least with product functionality related issues. That's worth five stars. But Intuit created a trust issue and I don't like looking over my shoulder for hidden gotchas. How am I supposed to trust software from a company I'm worried is trying to screw me? Even if not, I still find myself not trusting what Intuit says and always looking for a gotcha or some hidden meaning. That's one star territory. So we'll settle in the middle with three stars."

It appeared that I would have had to start the whole process all over in order to make the correction. Now it is possible that some of this may be user error or user's lack of knowledge on the use of this software; I still think that navigation, particularly where it involves going back a step or two, could have been easier. As for the lack of features which were standard in previous editions of this software (that so many have complained about), I was not affected by this. But I can understand the frustrations of those who were. Of course, Intuit finally listened and made a somewhat just remedy for the problem. Overall, a very good software."

3318,R17PU213UIR8NO,"TurboTax works better - in spite of this year's hot mess.","Everyone now knows of the hot mess Intuit created when they crippled the Deluxe version's handling of Schedules C and D. And due to the strong backlash they got from the customer base they pivoted and made it right again by upgrading Deluxe to whatever higher version you need for no charge, plus promising to revert back to the old Deluxe functionality. Now that the dust has settled I hope whatever team that recommended the altered version of Deluxe were shown the door. I've been a loyal TT customer for 10+ years like many of you. And, duly insulted by Intuit's money grab, I decided to go with H&R Block. So if you were wondering which worked best...read on. In a nutshell I got a $600 higher Federal refund and a state tax penalty that was $155 less by using TurboTax. There are several reasons why. TurboTax does a more thorough job importing prior year's data and matching it side-by-side, making it much easier to note changes. H&R only imported my demographics. The interview process is more polished in TT, and thoroughly fleshed out my tax situation, which made it more straightforward to discover valid deductions. Here's two important examples where H&R faltered: I have an adult child who I can claim as a qualified relative, but the interview process totally dropped the ball. I had to drill into the forms to manually capture them as a dependent, an important deduction. Later I entered student loan interest from two lenders, but when I reviewed the final return only one of them had an entry. I again drilled down into the forms to find that a check box had been omitted on a lender, leading H&R to believe the interest wasn't tax deductible. A potential $2000 difference. And there was nothing in the interview process to have led me to make that choice in error. So even after correcting the flaws and running both programs all the way though, TurboTax still managed a more favorable result. H&R Block is cheaper - no two ways about it. And it works quite well. But I believe you have to be more astute to avoid unexpected results. And for those who are truly paranoid about an audit here is the difference between the programs. H&R will provide someone to attend an audit with you for free. TurboTax has a $60 fee, but the (optional) service from TaxAudit means they will fully review your return and do battle before the IRS. You have no involvement. Pick your poison. So there's my experience. What I got back by using TurboTax more than made up for the higher expense (and this year's profound aggravation)."

I am a bit weary of the price increases coming up combined with a $25 cost for e-filing state tax I will have to consider if the minimal savings is worth the hassle of doing my own taxes."

I have use TT since its introduction and have always liked it. It loaded last year's files with no problem and walked me through the process as usual. The only negative I have this year is that it was supposed to allow me to choose when the IRS would be paid, e.g. April 15th but when I entered my payment method and information clicked next, it gave my a confirmation code and showed that my payment would be made immediately, I had to quickly rearrange some assets to cover the payment not to mention the loss of a couple of months of interest."

The addition of incorporating a State module was great!

The downside to the phone conversation is that it takes a long time to get a person on the phone and you have to listen to music for a long time. Then, when I got the income in the federal part of the form done and was doing the state form, the numbers all stayed in my column and nothing in my wife's. Another phone call, another long wait and another bout with the music. A different consultant but again was very helpful. We were going to unload the current program (from disc) and download from the internet to see if that would help. We got cut off from our phone conversation and I was faced with the phone routine again. I gave up for the time being and came back to it after a day or so to rest. I did the phone routine again and asked the consultant for a direct line so I would not have to go through the long wait time again if we got cut off. Turbo Tax does not allow this. Maybe you should work something out so customers would have quicker access. Maybe more consultants......?? Anyway, I reloaded the original program from the disc and went through the process again and it worked."

When you fire it up it automatically updates itself to be sure you are working with the latest information. It also automatically looks back at your previous returns and enters necessary info into your latest return. Then it talks you through the process step by step in very easy to understand instructions. It's like having a tax preparation person standing over your shoulder and guiding you every step of the way. My wife and I file jointly and our returns are fairly basic so the whole process, to sitting down in front of the computer to E-filing our returns took me about 90 minutes and I was by no means rushing. E-filing is simple, easy and fast and we had both State and Federal refunds in about 1 1/2 weeks. (It could have been even quicker but we opted to have checks mailed to our home instead of automatically placed into our bank account.) The only reason I did not give TurboTax 5 stars is because apparently they bumped some of the features usually found in TurboTax Deluxe into a higher-priced version without adequately informing buyers beforehand. I did get several E-mails from TurboTax regarding this before I bought the product so it did not affect me. I would definitely recommend TurboTax."

I was glad I read the reviews before purchasing. After seeing they were doing free upgrades to people who had used it in previous years, I decided to go ahead with TTax anyway. When I got to the point in the Deluxe software that said I needed an upgrade, it kept wanting to charge me for it. As with others, I had to call and wait on the phone for 20-40 minutes, but the rep eventually got me the free upgrade. I was a bit surprised though, as she sounded like this was an unknown thing. I said I figured they'd be used to it by now. Long story short... after the hassle, it eventually worked okay. I had some issues in the program this year that I'd never experienced before, but they all worked out. It said I was supposed to get a free state filing, but that didn't happen. And I had to rely on people on the forums when my state part wouldn't load. It ended up being because the software was upgraded from Deluxe to a higher version that it downloaded the state files in the OLD program folder for Deluxe, not the newer upgraded one. Thanks to the people on the forums for helping out with that! If they do what they said they'd do and put all the forms back in the original versions next year, I'll probably still use TTax again."

Fortunately, Turbo Tax did the upgrade at no additional charge, but I should not have had to upgrade to a different level program for something I had done and used for several years. Overall, I love using Turbo Tax; but if you change the product, you should not use the same name for the program. And, even though they did not charge for the upgrade (apparently they had a lot of complaints before mine); if I had just bought the premier level from the store it would have cost $40 extra.

3443,R1DF1UFD3933V2,"Mixed Feelings","I've been using TT for probably close to 20 years. I was about to switch to something else this year when I initially learned that the Deluxe version would no longer support information for stocks and bonds. TT backpedaled and prior year buyers of TT Deluxe received a free upgrade to the Premiere edition. However, I will jump ship next year if the Deluxe version does not include the above, as it has every year up to now. Anyway, I like the convenience of how TT automatically imports information from previous years without a lot of effort on my part. I do not like how it almost forces you to e-file your state return, even though it costs an additional $24.95 (only Fed e-file is free). Then, if you want to print out your state return and mail it in there's no easy way because you have to include certain fed tax return forms if you itemize, etc. The easy solution would be if TT offered a box to click on to e-file or another box to print out and mail in your state return right next to it. Just a small gripe. We will see what TT does with the Deluxe version next year."

Since it is The Standard, it might be useful to focus on the areas where it needs improvement. First and foremost, I object to having to purchase a new program every year. Why not have software that is update-able annually for a modest fee? Sure, the tax code changes but other software manages to function with updates. Secondly, why is Intuit stingy about State filings? You get one, if you pay for it but what if your family, like mine needs to file more than one State return? Third, if you have a lot of charitable contributions it is a real pain to get them all in there in a manner appropriate for the IRS. This is not strictly-speaking a problem with Intuit but as a company that promises ease-of-use I would expect them to come up with easier solutions to help out their loyal customers. I'm sure I will buy TurboTax next year, but these are ongoing grumbles from my perspective."

I agreed to the offer because I am always shopping on Amazon. I finished up the rest of my taxes and at the very end is the terms for the gift card.

If you don't know to search online, the Turbotax program just leads you to print the form and mail it.

After reading other comments by other long-time users of TurboTax about how easy it was to switch to a different software provider, I just need to make the switch next tax season.

Seeing that hundreds of users were also in the same maddening boat was little comfort. When there was finally a workable solution that I understood and could implement, it was still evident that the solution was not user-friendly for hundreds of users who were less familiar with how to find the TT program and then find the files that needed to be replaced by the ""solution"" files provided by the TT techs. At some point, I believe the solution was simply to click on ""update"" in the TT program itself, which is what it should have been from the beginnings (given that there was, in fact, a glitch that should not have been there from the beginning). So, contrary to the 7 prior years of being very pleased with TT, this year I experienced a time-wasting kind of frustration, annoyance, etc. If TT posted a notice anywhere stating that users may / probably would experience a glitch with importing key financial data from itsdeductible.com, I didn't see it. It certainly didn't come as a warning pop-up during my usage of the program. So, I'm disappointed by the Intuit organization. They could have and should have done better. Perhaps a charge-back to Intuit for my time which is rather precious to me, but for ""settlement"" purposes, I would tolerate $50 / hour. Nonetheless, I expect that I'll return again next year with intense optimism that such a glitch won't occur. But, please!!!, Intuit, develop better communication and reparation procedures. Hundreds, probably thousands, of us depend on a flawless program. After all, we are filing legal documents with the fed. govt. I've heard that the govt. has a limited sense of humor about faulty filings. Likewise, so do users relative to faulty programs. One more chance for you."

You don't really have an easy way to know what the final costs will be until you have bought the software, installed it and put in all of your information.

You still have to do all the research and find all the numbers for your deductions, income, etc. You still have to want to document how much your car registrations were. The tool is thorough and good at asking all the questions to maximize your refund or minimize your additional tax payment. It also provides fairly good explanations about the questions in case they are confusing. For entry of the basic tax information and moving through your return I give this tool high marks. However, when you go off script and want to jump around, it becomes more difficult to use. There seems to be a big push to file electronically. This is fine for the federal return since that cost is included, however, filing electronically for state is another $20 (ridiculous when you are making it easier for everyone involved in the tax process). For this reason I still mail my state return when I really do not want to. Every year, I have to spend extra time trying to figure out how to print my state return to send. Why they do not have a button right where you file electronically to allow you to print the return for mailing I find disturbing. You can spend $20 in time trying to figure out how to do this because TT refuses to make it easy.

H&R worked about as well as Turbo Tax for our needs (married filing jointly with itemized deductions but nothing really special). However, Intuit dropped its price gouge meanwhile. And when it came time to file, we found out that with state and federal e-filing, using H&R Block's software would have cost $110, while Turbo Tax would have cost $60. Plus tax in both cases. H&R imported our 2013 Turbo Tax 1040 just fine. But since we hadn't had to pay up front for H&R (I think that's true in both cases), when we discovered we'd have to pay $50 extra to use H&R Block, we canceled the filing, downloaded Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 and used that. Funny thing is, when Turbo Tax went through its features & pricing gyrations, all H&R Block needed to do was match them when their price came back down. They didn't, and so missed a great opportunity to pick up new customers like us. Four stars because it wouldn't load our 2013 1040, which we'd prepared with Turbo Tax. Finally I wound up having to fire up last year's version of Turbo Tax, load the 2013 return, then save it to a different location--which worked.

Now my return is fairly simple, retirement income--Social Security and income from our IRA accounts--no rental propteties, nothing special. The ""Deluxe"" Turbo Tax that was offered this year would have handled my needs, just as it had since 2007. But I tought Turbo Tax needed to lose some skin. Didn't turn out that way. Was a glitch in the H&R Block program that double counted my withheld tax, and no matter how I tried, could not get it corrected. So, I wrote off my sunk cost of some $40 in H&R Block, and bought the Turbo Tax Deluxe. Worked just as it always had, no problems, logical queries, all the things I was used to in past years. Filed my Federal Taxes electronically, mailed in the state return as always, and got my small refund from IRS in less than ten days. I think that Turbo Tax management might have listened to some dummy MBA who convinced them to further segment their market, and capitalize on upselling. From what I read, they have incurred a lot of pain from it, and hopefully the people involved in the changes, and the poor communications of the changes have been given the opportunity to place their next employer in deep jeopardy.

3653,R1P5BGCTWI1XR6,"Saves Time, Reduces Headaches, State Filing Software Needs Improvement","I find it interesting that TurboTax promotes getting the biggest refund as why you should get TurboTax. Honestly...in three years of using it I have not seen any extra refund because of TurboTax. My taxes aren't simple --- itemized deducations, interest income, stock dividends or capital --- so there is room to find a hidden nugget. It's just that those nuggets are pretty obvious. WHY I GET TurboTax is for three other reasons: 1) speed of completing my taxes, 2) catching the new laws and rules seamlessly (like health insurance this year), and 3) easily filing state taxes. What used to take me several hours (at least), aw well as considerable grief from reading and re-reading the complex tax instructions, now only takes an hour if I have all my reference paperwork ready. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT about TurboTax is the high cost for State taxes. In my situation I worked in one state and lived in another. So I would buy the TurboTax with one State filing included, but getting that second state costs nearly as much as my original TurboTax software. I am already a loyal customer year after year...wouldn't it be better to encourage me to use all your services by making it more cost-effective. This year I decided to do the second state on my own because of the high cost. MY OTHER COMPLAINT is the quality of the State versions of TurboTax. I know they have 50 states to deal with, but it feels like their Level 2 team works on the state versions. Instructions aren't as clear. Flow is clunky at times. I have less confidence in my State returns through TurboTax than the Federal. It still simplifies my tax filing life, so I live with it."

Instead of spending the money, I looked at the Nebraska e-file website and filed my taxes using the website's program. It was quick and easy. Before you spend the extra money for state tax return, verify your state will do it online for free and you don't have any convoluted tax stuff to deal with. Other than that, TurboTax is easy to use, it imports your old tax returns and helps guide you along to see if there any new changes.

TurboTax does not have a way to properly handle the annual reporting of US Savings Bonds Interest on Form 1040. While most people report savings bonds interest when they redeem the bonds, IRS does allow you to annually report the accrual of bond interest, so that you do not need to report multiple years interest when the bonds are redeemed. While I was able to manually identify the bond interest on Form 1040 as being annually reported, TurboTax was not able to automatically transfer this amount to my State tax form (WI), which subtracts US interest from income. I had to manually enter the amount on my State tax form during a final review before e-filing the form. This has the potential of paying more state tax than you should. 2.) When I purchased this product I thought that it not only included the State Forms, but also the e-filing of the State Form. It does not. You can print a paper copy of the State form and mail it in. But if you wish to e-file the State form, who must pay an additional $20 to do so. I think that the price of the product should include e-filing of both the Federal and State forms."

Intuit responded after numerous complaints and corrected its marketing fiasco. Now here we go again. On the software box, it notes that a state e-filing fee is $19.99--but in a footnote to that pricing, in fine print, it notes that the price may increase. Well guess what? On March 20, 2015, in the middle of tax filing season, Intuit increased the state e-filing fee from $19.99 to $24.99 and the only way you know that is immediately before you hit ""click"" to file your tax return. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Our friends at Intuit continue to ""nickel and dime"" the customer. Apparently, this mid-tax season price increase is normal--it happened to me last year too, I just did not realize it! Intuit has such a good product but they are trying everything possible to make customers angry at them.

If you don't mind paying the increase (used to hover around $30-$40 years ago, is more like $50-$60 now), then this software will be fine for you.

I tried to contact Intuit to report the error, but found it nearly impossible. I searched their website and blog, only to find others who unsuccessfully tried to report errors. The absence of a mechanism to report errors greatly reduces my confidence in this software. I have used this software in the past, but I am not sure I will continue to do so.

Unfortunately, he moved out of the area sometime in 2012, so I was really worried how I was going to file for 2013. I have friends that have always sworn by TurboTax, but I had never tried it. So, to file for the year 2013, I bought my first copy of TurboTax. It was surprisingly easy. Even so, I was still worried up until I received both my Federal and State refunds. I filed again this year using TurboTax, and even e-filed my returns for the first time. TurboTax guided me through the whole process once again, and even allowed me to easily find reasonable prices to use for itemizing each of my many smaller donation items for 2013. Worked out great!

TT's special deal with Amazon meant a 10% boost in the return amount from the feds (if you are eligible), which was and is appreciated. Note: I was worried a bit about the well publicized problems with infiltration by villains, who hijack money, but I had no problems since I filed relatively early.

Interestingly, even when I corrected the mistake, Turbo Tax didn't raise a fuss. Apparently it liked the return the wrong as well as the correct way. I purchased the second state from Turbo Tax for $40, only then did it tell me that it couldn't totally complete my return for that state. I would need to go onto the state website and download some additional forms to complete, then file manually.

When I had a small consulting business and earned enough, Turbo Tax was a good value. Now that I am working at a P/T recession era job, Turbo Tax is a bit pricey, but I have very little patience for wading through NJ income tax forms. For the few hundred dollars that NJ takes from a basically legally poor person, they compound the issue with a tax form that a CPA needs training to do. Turbo Tax needs to sell a stripped down version for the working poor, they would sell more product. Also, they need to reduce the efile charges.

Bottom line is, I feel like (and I think that's the most important issue with just about any negotiable purchase) its legally lowering my liability as much as possible while paying for itself at the same time."

The copy last year was limited copy that Turbo was testing and they then released it this year. I have the most basic tax needs and I did my taxes and then when I went to file on line I was directed to upgrade my program at cost of $39..99 on top of the fee that I had already paid. I was told to wait until February 7th and Turbo was upgrading free. I will not be using Turbo Tax next year. Just up the cost of the program but do not sell it and then tell customers that they must pay more after they input tax information and want to file. I always file EZ so why do I have to upgrade my software."
3756,R2DQQ7YVA2ABKM,"Works well for me!","I've used Turbo Tax for years and like the system. My only problem with it is that I have deductions and don't have to pay State Tax. I'd love for them to come out with an edition that is a little cheaper where a person could just file with deductions, Federally. It's really easy if you follow the directions, and if you don't understand, there are usually links explaining what is necessary. I once tried a local accountant because I thought I'd have too many things going on - that bill was over $700.00. She was incredibly understanding when I complained and ended up charging me nothing - but, I filed an amended return using Turbo and ended up getting more money. A couple of years ago I had a major glitch - don't know what happened, but an incorrect return was filed . .. . had to jump through some hoops, but managed to get everything straightened out. I don't know if it was a problem with Turbo or something I did, but I decided to continue with Turbo and have not been disappointed."

But, this year was the best ever. This tax-filing program is pretty darn smooth. Filing taxes is never a joyous occasion for me. Gathering up the support, and verifying the information I've got is absolutely boresome. But, I have to say, getting it all into TurboTax is just about painless. I move back and forth between ""guided mode"" and the ""I know what I'm doing mode"" but, in the final analysis, I use all of the automatic checking features built into the program before filing. There are several slick features built into the program--comparing all entries to last year's filing as I enter information is one--but maybe the best one is showing what my tax saving would be if I added money to my IRA. This year I turned a Federal/State net ""no refund, no payment"" total into a net ""$1,500 refund"" by adding about twice amount that to my IRA. Good stuff! This year I'd made my new 2014 IRA contribution and filed both Federal and State taxes in mid-Feburary... I got the State refund in a week ago and the Federal refund just hit my bank account. I'm happy with TurboTax!"

3762,R28VF46ZPGK7SY,"Turbo Tax - Thumbs Up","Turbo Tax is an excellent tax software package that is user friendly and walks you through the entire tax preparation process in a quick, easy manner, guiding you through from beginning to end, following the same logic as if you were attempting to do the 1040 by yourself. My return is moderately complicated and I was able to complete both Federal and State returns in about 2 hours. The printouts provide a great, easy to follow audit trail. The electronic submission was quick with immediate feedback. The software also finds you the maximum amount of money in the process. For example, there are different forms and choices one can make in terms of education credits. Turbo tax runs through the various options and chooses the best one for you. Most of your information is transferred over the following tax season. The price of $50 was very reasonable, considering the alternative of paying for a tax accounting service or a tax accountant. I would strongly recommend this software to everyone and am giving it a 5 star rating."
3763,R228NBXAS8PLP3,"I like the software","I like the software, it works this year (tax year 2014) just as well as all years, and the steps for including my HSA were handled well. My biggest gripe is how critical features seemed to spread across to higher-level versions. Many people have heard of the feature moves that forced customers to upgrade from the middle-tier version up to premium. That same issue caused me to have to move from Basic to Deluxe (or whatever the middle one is called). It is only a small monetary difference, but if I hadn't been diligent about reading the literature I'd have bought the same version I've been using for years only to find it lacked 1099-MISC support and been screwed into having to drive back to my local store and go through an exchange process. Torpedoes some of the 'convenience' of doing your own taxes at home. At any rate, the thrust is this: It is still a great and easy-to-use package, but be SURE you know which version will cover your needs. I'm dingin' 'em a star for this change that seems to have no real basis other than to squeeze a few more dollars out of every customer."

I feel so secure with turbo tax, and the experience was easy. I always try to have my paperwork in order and ready, but with few changes in the filing, I had to reset my documents somewhat. I feel safe, secure, love it, easy to do, and what I pay for turbo tax is a far cry from what I would pay an accountant which I know use turbo tax. You have step by step and can correspondence with agent. Love it....Easy fast, print my return and refunds rapidly returned.

I wrote an email to TurboTax complaining about this and so must have a lot of other people because TurboTax replied with an apology stating they had messed up by making these changes and would make it good by letting everyone who had purchased the Deluxe edition upgrade to the premium level at no charge. This was really big of them. I did get the upgrade but I will seriously consider if I will ever purchase TurboTax in the future. As I said, earlier, I have used TurboTax for many previous years, but their decision to deceive the public first then try to make up by offering to fix the mistake will make me think long and hard before I will ever purchase TurboTax, again.

I also don't like the fact that they make it cumbersome to use eFile for federal tax, but to use paper to file one's state tax. $25 to electronically file state tax, or any tax, it too much. It isn't a great problem, but it is annoying what one must do to accomplish this. I also do not like that the option to apply a refund to one's next year's federal tax did not appear.

Why did they do this? Who knows. I feel that whomever came up with this marketing strategy should be shown the door, and the CEO/President of the company should make financial restitution to the many users that have been disappointed by this turn of events.

I'm familiar with another tax product and TurboTax is miles ahead of the other one. Easy to actually file and I got my Federal and State refunds in less than 10 days. But there are a couple of things that could use a little help. First, sometimes the questions to be answered are bold and sometimes they aren't. I much prefer the bold route because it is easy to read quickly and understand what you need to answer. When the questions are in plain text, it can be hard to make sure that you are answering the right thing. Second, the correctness of some of the state questions were in question as was the path taken as a result. In one case, I went through a section twice and still didn't get to where I should have been, so I had to go in and manually correct the state form. I realize that there are a lot of different states and state forms and that keeping up with them is difficult, so I'm not terribly upset about that."
3776,R1G9RR4L91ZKPP,"Should let you know which form to file according to your AGI at beginning of program -","It would be nice if they had a feature that told you upfront, when entering your earnings, how much $$$ you would need in deductions for medical, donations, taxes paid, etc. to qualify for itemized filing. The bulk of my time doing taxes was spent on adding up all our medical bills (over 8k), several thousand in donations and taxes - and I was still better off taking the 'standard deduction'. A huge waste of my time. Other than that, the program walks you through step by step. And if you worked in a city that was listed in the program, it allows you to print that completed form, sign it, stuff it in an envelope and mail it to get your city refund. That is a fantastic feature!! We had purchased a home and sold property in the past three years, so we had a CPA do our taxes. Now that our situation has no complications, will definitely be using TurboTax from now on! All in all a very great product."

I believed I must have done something wrong but after multiple checking and re-entering data, today I know not what I did wrong. If the error was mine, perhaps Turbotax is a tad trickier to use than it should be. I was able to devise a work around so my taxes were submitted correctly. Perhaps Turbotax has a bug.

I have no idea how many different updates came through since February, but if they were all the same, for God's sake recognize I have already received it.

It backfired, of course, and they did give a free upgrade. But I'll be paying close attention next year to what they package. I've used TurboTax for close to 20 years so I was very disappointed by that move. The software itself is relatively easy to use. I would say that, thanks to my investment firm, I'm having to figure out doing an Amended Return and TurboTax is not particularly straightforward or helpful about that."

But it was a bit different this year and some of the questions I had to read a couple of times to make sure I was totally understanding them. I didn't like having to answer about healthcare even though I kow there was a reason for it. There were questions that weren't on there this year but have been in previous years, plus there were questions on there for the first time. All in all it is fairly easy to go through and get done with your taxes in a couple of hours if you have eveything else prepared and in front of you."

I will be paying attention next year. The Deluxe version also needs a FREE state tax efile. The extra charge for a state efile ($29.99) is a rip-off! Wish the cost could be deducted from my taxes but that will take an IRS ruling. Actually the Feds should provide a FREE electronic filing system but don't hold your breath for our crooked government to actually do something for our benefit. The software also needs to remember exactly where you left off instead of walking you through all of it again. When we save a file, take us back to where we were when we saved it! Is that too much to ask, TurboTax?"
3812,R3MUOMS4TP7S96,"Not as good as it used to be","Previous versions at this price point could handle small business deductions and revenues, but this time they want double the price to do that. My wife and I each have tiny side businesses with a few hundred dollars in net profit for the year. I want to report all income properly but will be damned if I'll spend an extra $49 to correctly report $200-300 in net income. I showed it under other income rather than reporting it under small business income. Even though Florida has no state income tax, the stupid software keeps pushing me to buy state tax software as well."

My only compliant is with the use of the State filing of the software. Once the federal section was completed, and you selected the state for doing the state section a message popped up stating that you have one free subscription for e-filing the state return and would you like to use it now. I selected yes and continued doing the taxes. However, after the state was completed, and the e-file option was subjected. The software would not let you process the return without first paying for it. I first though that this was hardcoded into the software and that Turbo would later wave the charge. I was proven wrong by the charge showing up on my credit card. If I had known this would be the case I would have mailed my return."
3814,R2HLJIM146CGGC,"Old Reliable!","After the first year, it's pretty easy to do your taxes! We have been using TurboTax since it was a DOS program called something else, and we wouldn't be without it. It's reliable, quite easy to use, and available early enough in the season to get a head start on planning. I generally use the ""go to what I want to enter"" mode and I'm glad it's still available. By chance, we avoided the brouhaha about the differences between Premier and Deluxe - I bought what we used the previous year and it worked fine. So I'm not even mad about that."

However, I was very disappointed that Intuit reduced the content from previous years. Most people have stocks or mutual funds, so eliminating support for Federal Schedule D reduced the usefulness of Deluxe to barely above Basic.Even though they belatedly offered a ""free"" upgrade for customers who had used 2013 Deluxe, it was extra work for anyone who had purchased Deluxe believing it had the same capabilities as in previous years. Not a very smart way to treat repeat customers. I plan to check early for 2015 tax preparation. If Intuit repeats their mistake in 2015 I will probably try one of the competing software packages."

I was checking to see how things would come out if I filed Head of Household instead of single since my son was living with me. I keyed that in and proceeded to the health insurance section. At that time I decided to just claim Single as in the past. I went back and made the change. But as I moved through the subsequent pages, the program would not recognize this change. After many attempts, I poked around a bit in Tools and saw that forms were saved with Head of Household. I then realized I needed to back out completely from Turbo Tax without saving and start over completely. It would have been nice it the system were able to change the form or at least prompt me somehow to let me know what to do."

Overall a very simple system, easy to use and quick. I would suggest a couple of ""options"" in the printing section: One option to simply printing the return itself without pages of support documentation. (For your files) Another option for those that like to file paper returns, is a selection to print a return for mailing. This option should also print an address label to the regional IRS Office.

If Turbo Tax had not eventually provided the upgrade free of charge, I would definitely use a different product next year. I'm also going to check the Turbo Tax box very closely next year and if the Deluxe doesn't meet my needs as it has for the last 7 years, I'll give serious consideration to a competitor's product. The price seems to go up every year and, quite frankly, I'm tired of it. I gave 4 stars because once the free upgrade was loaded, I was happy with my returns."

After doing a search online, I discovered it was a known problem & that I would have to put in the info by hand. I wouldn't have bought the program if I knew it had a known problem. That being said, I'm glad I did. It's the first time I did not have to figure out the crazy calculations that Missouri uses. Turbotax handled it for me, which H&R Block did not do in previous years. And Turbotax had a better flow. Worth the extra money to me."

I had to check my bank account periodically to see if the refund had been posted. Nothing from Turbotax. Then, the Colorado fiasco! I understand that mistakes are made, but Turbo-tax has not communicated about this except in the news. No messaging. No notices. I've been a member for about 10 years, and I'm not happy.

The ""Likeliness of getting audited"" indicator at the end of the program gave me confidence that I did it right.

Second item--I did my daughter's taxes using TurboTax deluxe--because of what the IRS thought was a security problem last year, they issued her a 6 digit pin code to enter on the return.

Didn't think it would make that much difference. I was interupted several times so I tried to continue where I'd left off. As a result, TT downloaded my bank interest twice, and I didn't notice it until after I e filed. Big mistake. I'll have to do the whole thing over and file an amended return. Will I use TT next year?

3864,R2WMLVNEI4P5SW,"You ought to have a way to call someone to ask questions when somethingm like this happens.","The Turbo Tax that I bought and used this year would not allow me to file my Federal tax electronicly. There was no explanation of why it would not file. My son figured that I needed a newer version of explorer for my browser. When I downloaded a newer version I was able to file. Your Turbo Tax did not say you had to have a certain browser for it to work. You ought to have a way to call someone to ask questions when something like this happens. I looked everywhere for a phone number and there was none. I think I might try a different tax than Turbo Tax next year. I believe there was a number to call a couple of years ago."
3865,R162M7ESZ54DMZ,"For many years I have used TurboTax Basic with good results and satisfaction","For many years I have used TurboTax Basic with good results and satisfaction. This year product labeling led me to believe I required the Deluxe edition, despite no change in my tax situation. I bought and used the Deluxe edition and during the course of entering data was informed I needed another upgrade - for some $40 - for investment forms. After several attempts, I was able to proceed without purchasing additional products and completed and filed my taxes as usual. In short, the product worked fine as usual, but I felt taken advantage of by the initial labeling and subsequent efforts to again charge me for services I did not need."
3866,R2RXSK9B6R55KP,"In the Nebraska state tax, they referred to a ...","In the Nebraska state tax, they referred to a Nebraska form, but the form was not supplied by TurboTax, and I had to search for it and determine if it was relevant to the return I was preparing. Also, it would be helpful to have an ""EXPRESS"" finish preparing where after all the income items are covered one can then just finish by only taking the standard deduction instead of having to go through everything in the deductions section just to end up being told that the standard deduction is the way to go."

Also, all of the years in the past the State Tax Return was already included in the total or a part of the total pkg. I didn't have to pay an extra 19.95 to file the state return in the pas after I had already paid for the Deluxe version.. I have used TurboTax for years and it still is the best around but some of the changes this year was not as much of a bargain as in the past. I will stick with it until I can no longer understand it or get through the process of filing a return through TurboTax."
3868,R157EAVO8MYZLY,"It has always made doing my taxes easy. However","I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years. It has always made doing my taxes easy. However, this year the Deluxe Version cost the same but left out several tax forms that were available in 2013. I almost switched to H & R block because it was a lot cheaper and had those tax forms and it could also download my last year's Turbo Tax information. I received an email from Turbo Tax that apologized that the Deluxe Version had been changed and promised to change it back in 2015. I will wait and see what happens. If the price jumps or if the forms are not available and I have to purchase the Premier Version, then I will probably switch to H&R Block software."
3869,RWT3ZB3SJ8OIS,"Helped me get it done!!!","I've never done my own taxes before and found this was pretty easy to use. The part I didn't like, particularly with the state portion, was that some questions were way too complicated for me to understand. It seemed that if there were 10 questions, 9 of them were easy to understand, and 1 was impossible to understand. Overall though, it helped me get the job done and I'll use it again next year."
3870,R2CN1QVCRROAKM,"Old version was better","Although TT made things right by not charging for it this year, I did not like the surprise of having to ""upgrade"" to a business version in order to get Schedule C and other forms that were in the regular deluxe version before this year. Looks like going forward, will have to cough up the extra bucks. And the only reason I had to do this was because I get about $50 a year from a nearby natural gas fracking well as royalty $$. What a pain. And the net net is about $0.00 after taxes and paying for the extra TT version!!"

In the past, I was always able to use the basic version. They got me for more money this year, maybe next year I go with HR Block's software and see how I make out with that. And yes, they offered to give back $25. for that, but of course I didn't qualify due to the fact that they had no record of my previous purchases. Thanks a lot guys!!"

I made a mistake on my state return after I had initially finished it. When I changed the entry by clicking on the edit bar, the entry changed there but not on the finished tax form. Then, when I attempted to print just one form from the state return,the desired form was highlighted in blue but when I clicked on print review, I got a box telling me to select a form. I tried several times, with the same frustrating result. I finally changed the entry by hand on the return filed. Next year I intend to investigate other software tax vendors."
3874,R2T5ZI9QN154DM,"Still A Great Software","I've used TurboTax for years for the federal and state return. I used the Deluxe version for federal and e-file of state. I had no sales of stock of other out of the ordinary transactions, so I was not caught up with paying extra for additional forms. However, I noticed when I bought the software, all of the packaging was the same, and I had to look hard to determine that I had the right version. My neighbor was not so cautious and he ended up purchasing the wrong version."
3875,R1T0Q7X9RVCV1P,"Is it worth it","Every year I would go to HandR Block and pay over 200.00 to file my taxes. I would go prepared with all numbers for my business and personal deductions. I sat there the last year that I used HandR Block watching me giving him all of the information that I worked so hard to gather and the agent asking how much, putting it in the computer and letting the program tell me how much. I decided that I could type information into a computer just as easy as he did and that I could save myself over 200.00 a year for charges. I have been using Turbo Tax for over 12 years and I don't regret switching."
3876,R23M7IZPB9H7S,"Staying with TurboTax","This product did what I needed. I am as frustrated with everyone else's comments on the product changing and followed the backlash closely. I however did not need to file a schedule C and/or E. I contacted HR Block and they provided a copy of their software, I prepared the taxes with both and was more pleased with the flow of TurboTax and filed using this software. In future years I will stay with TurboTax as I like the software more than competitors."

New this year, you have to enter all medical, even HSA paid items, and then the magnificent program deducts the HSA re-Imbursement. Why? It's method of dealing with HSA deposits keeps getting more convoluted; if I already checked no, why does it still run me through all the question instead of letting me move on to my spouse's yes? No is no."

Turbo tax has become like so many other entities today -product appears the same as the past - name is the same - price is the same but the product is lacking substance - some what like the cereal and cracker producers are doing - you think you are getting the same - but product in the box is much less than in the past.

I was not happy this year when at the end and I was ready to pay for my state taxes to be e-filed I also paid for the extra protection in case I would get audited. I did not want that service but was not allowed to not take some how. I just paid for it even though I didn't need it. My returns are very simple and needing any extra protection. I am pretty sure it was something I did by mistake but couldn't find a way to change it. Next year I will be more careful and read the end instructions better so to not get the protection that is not needed."
3881,R1HCMGAX4446IZ,"Frustrating Problem","I've used TurboTax several times before without any issues, but I had a frustrating problem this time. I wasn't able to submit my state tax return online. I didn't find anything applicable in the user community, and I waited on the phone for 45 minutes with no one picking up. I finally ended up mailing my state return, and I'm hoping that it doesn't go astray to a thief who steals my refund. I'm very frustrated. I may give TurboTax one more opportunity to keep my business, but if I have any issues with my 2015 returns, I'll be done with them."

The program is expensive. It may not have changed since last year, but I didn't think I had to pay for filing my Federal taxes previously. I would say that $20.00 less might have ""felt"" better. When I finished I didn't feel confident with the amount of the refund for my Federal filing. I did get a refund, however, and felt good about that"

I had a gift card from Costco and TurboTax was marked down and I decided just to try it and if I didn't like it I could still go back and have my CPA do them again. I was blown away at how it took me through every step of the way and how easy it was to follow along. I got it done in under an hour and got a great refund.

I started using Turbo Tax 9 years ago when my husband became ill and the tax filing duty fell upon me for the first time in many years. I quickly became a great fan of this program, but I felt disappointed with this year's version. Not as easy to use and more difficult to install correctly. Hopefully they will get their act together and next year they will go back to what they were previously doing, which was much better than this year's formatting. I will try again next year, and hopefully all will go well again."

I use the guided feature and if you can read and answer questions you can use it. Several years ago I ended up owing because of an error made in my pension deductions by the retirement board. My taxes were complicated because I retired in June, started social security in August and began my pension in September. I thought I had made an error so I took it to H&R block for a second look. I took three year's worth of turbo tax prepared taxes. They told me that they had been done perfectly. I love turbo tax and recommend it to everyone."

If they can import your information like for your W2's, they will so you don't have to enter it. If you donate a lot, like for example I donate a lot of clothes, they make it easy for you to estimate that. Seriously, this could not be any easier to use and I know I will use it every year."

For some reason the 2014 version didn't seem to work as smoothly as in prior years and left me feeling less confident about the accuracy of my tax return. In fairness, this could have been caused by a few changes to my tax situation. Also, the $24.95 additional charge to e-file my Oregon return seems a little steep. I elected to print it and mailed it in."

So that said, I have used this version of Turbo Tax in the past, I used them this year and I'm happy to report I'll use them in the future. They still provide the best value and service for my needs.

I was really disappointed to find it would not allow a very simple small business return.

3920,R1MSDTA6NK2OU5,"TurboTax is quick, easy and secure. I definitely recommend this software for completing your taxes.","TurboTax not only helps to maximize my refund but also saves me significant time in the process. It accomplishes both by automatically retrieving information from last year's tax return that I completed using TurboTax, extracts the W2 information automatically, and allows me to verify the information for accuracy. It's easy to use and I no longer dread the mundane process of completing my tax return each year. Most importantly, it uses a secure PIN so I am assured to receive my refund without the risk of someone stealing my identity and stealing my refund."

I am actively looking for another product."

Since 2013 I had changed computers and was not able to carry forward some of the input such as charitable giving addresses, but this was not a factor in TurboTax performance. Overall I was again fully satisfied with the performance, speed and accuracy of TurboTax. I was very confident that my taxes had been accurately and carefully computed. I recommend it as an excellent product!"
3923,R1C1SYPSTORYNX,"Turbo Tax is easily the best","Of all the tax prep software's out there, Turbo Tax is easily the best. I'm a CPA and while I could fairly easily do my returns using far less expensive and capable software, I choose Turbo Tax because of its easy navigation of step by step as well as forms based inputs. I've tried several other programs, including Tax Cut and the frustration factor is dramatically less for Turbo Tax. Its worth the extra money. I gave the program 4 stars only because of the cost, especially for online state filings."
3924,RT9X2SHEFGDG8,"Didn't process 1099-R correctly","The program would not let me enter an annuity1099-R without providing a RMD amount, for which there is none. It treated it as a IRA distribution and wouldn't allow me to continue. I found no way to directly call TT to get them to modify their app. The annuity company, AXA, informed me that many people have called them saying they were experiencing the same problem."
3925,R26KIKXS5W3JI6,"Turbo tax is even cheaper to purchase and there a great help.","Well, I did get my taxes done at an accounts office, but then I heard of turbo tax and wow, what a change. That other account I went to didn't do half of what turbo tax does me/us. I asked him about what I could write off on my taxes and he just sat there is his chair with a shitty smirk on his face, thank you turbo tax. Turbo tax is even cheaper to purchase and there a great help."

For me the disk version worked much better for downloading. I would like it better if it were less time consuming to get through doing my taxes. Over all I think Intuit has a good product here in the Turbo Tax Deluxe."
3928,RQAUNITGPSS86,"Once again disappointed!","Once again it was ok but, once again when I said I only wanted to only e-file my Federal return and not both, the software did not ask if I wanted to enter my bank information for direct deposit. I had to look at the forms and enter the information manually. I noticed that it does ask if you have a refund on both Federal and State and are e-filing both returns. I am seriously considering going back to TaxCut, or whatever they are calling it this year, just on that issue alone!"

3930,R336M2FZ4J70NY,"highly recommend TurboTax","I have used TurboTax to do my taxes the last four years. I am very happy with the product. It makes it very easy to do taxes. And maximize refund or reduce taxes. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I wish you could sort the contributions list. It is tedious enough to entire each charity (guess we give to too many). It would be a great help if the list could be sorted instead of in the order originally entered."
3931,R1CG3FMEMQZ31C,"I was disappointed. I had used Turbo Tax for the previous ...","I was disappointed. I had used Turbo Tax for the previous 6 years and had no problem with it. This year they did not include the State Tax forms. They wanted and additional $39.99 for the State Forms. I was not happy. I really like Turbo Tax but felt like I was cheated this year. There were no notices sent out about it."
3932,R19QCHSXW82SV8,"So Easy Even I can Do It","I haven't had to do my own taxes in over 40 years, I married my accountant. He was sick last year so I had to do them myself, I was scared to death. The last time I did mine I did it in pencil using the different charts and calculations - ugh! I asked my daughter to help me through it but I really didn't need much help. It was so easy even I could do it!! I'm extremely pleased with TurboTax and I don't see the need to use anything else. I LOVE IT! Thank you TurboTax!"
3933,R21JFHORV6OWLJ,"Turbo Tax Deluxe is very good tax software","On the whole, Turbo Tax Deluxe is very good tax software, user friendly and quite accurate. There is one important exception in regard to one of the allocations in the Iowa state tax calculation. This allocation does not follow the clear instructions for the Iowa return, and the Turbo Tax calculation results in a major distortion of the resultant tax. Luckily, Turbo Tax permits the user to override and insert the correct allocation. I have provided the details twice in letters to Turbo Tax, without consequent correction of the software."
3934,R1G6YBA3SKF5HC,"DO THE MAIN TAXES FIRST ALWAYS!","I like Turbo Tax, however I am finding that unless I do my taxes first, the dependents are given the exemption that I should be getting for them. We have two dependents on our taxes still who are over 18 years old. Turbo Tax should flag a ""dependent"" and not allow the return to be e-filed until the main taxes are filed. Now I have to do an amendment on one of the dependents and I cannot seem to do it on Turbo Tax software. I have to file a 1040X in order to get it fixed and my taxes are not done yet so everything is messed up."
3935,R3N4RW948CO3TE,"Not what I expected","Although I did not have any Investment and or trading activity to report to the IRS, I was really discouraged when I found out this feature was not supported by the Deluxe product any longer. I read other reviews and found a large number of people upset about this change. Many had to pay additional fees on top of the cost of purchase for the TurboTax software. With all of the problems that have happened this tax season, I may think twice next year about continuing to use TurboTax."
3936,R20PS59TSPYUDE,"No better tax software than Turbo Tax","I have been using Turbo Tax software since 1996 and found it was easy to use and actually helped you from making mistakes, When I was audited by the IRS Turbo Tax answered some of my questions on how to handle the audit request, Have used it for small business, real estate rentals and home use and am always satisfied.with the results. I recommend Turbo Tax to all my friends."
3937,R1Q248OALWZAV6,"not too happy with the program this year","Well, not too happy with the program this year. When I got to the end, ready to file, the program asked me to pay AGAIN. I purchased the program at Office Max (depot). Anyway, I didn't find this year program as easy to use in previous years. Will think about buying a different Tax Program next year. PS: I don't think I should have to pay another $19.98 to file my State Return when I purchased the ""State Return"" with the Federal Delux program. Shouldn't indicate on the box you get a State return, but still have to pay e-file."
3938,R9KBN6YW85WQO,"It created a good deal of confusion","I was put off by the changes TurboTax made to their product offerings this year. It created a good deal of confusion. However, once I sat down to prepare my taxes, I was able to navigate through the program easily. It's still a good product. My one complaint: the amounts charged for e-filing (after the one free federal return) seem very high to me. Just another profit source for Intuit, I suppose."
3939,R1N3BYQSKC1LML,"Easy to use, but not problem free.","Turbo tax 2014 Federal was easy to follow and walked me through all of my various deductions. However, when doing my donations the program gave me the option of using various instead of entering multiple dates for my donations. When the program was checking for accuracy it said various was not a valid date entry and made me enter a date, but did not give the option to enter more than one donation date. I hope that this does not raise a flag with the IRS and end up getting me audited."
3940,R18EZXCOQLJVF9,"A friend of minds recommended it. I only had a few problems","this was my second year using Turbo Tax. A friend of minds recommended it. I only had a few problems. I could not find how to back it up on my flash drive and after completing the form how to get back to the beginning. It would always start me at the end. I didn't want to go back through the whole thing. I will use it again next year it was easy except for those two problem, it could have been me not understanding . I always went to H&R Block . the first year my friend did it with me this year I did it on my own."
3941,R16IO39DZB20WG,"I enjoy the fact that I don't have to rely on ...","This is my second year doing Turbo Tax. I know it takes a long time to complete it, but that's because Turbo Tax goes through every item and if I don't understand something there are help clicks to read and even more information if I don't get it the first time. What is most helpful is the review for mistakes at the end and Turbo Tax has found a couple. I enjoy the fact that I don't have to rely on someone doing it for me. It's a workout on my head, but it stimulates my brain!!"

It took a call to your customer service to untangle this knot. However, Customer Service forgave the State charge for the inconvenience caused by the problem and for that I thank you and will use Turbotax again next year. C M Littleton"
3943,R1AQIW769FYDBA,"main tax form screen needs a little tweaking","One thing is of constant annoyance to me is the following: after completing one form or item, it returns to the main screen, but I have to page down in order to click the next item button. My suggestion is this: either position you at the bottom of the screen automatically (1st choice) or put a next item button at the top of the screen. I know this seems minor, but not many people do not love doing their taxes. Every little smoothing out is good."
3944,RQEBSJHPHSNGP,"Best TurboTax Version Yet","I have used turbo tax deluxe for many years..this year was no exception. For some reason the 2014 version seemed better than past versions..for the couple of instances I needed to go directly to the forms to make adjustments each processed clearly and simply. We had the largest federal refund in over ten years and received it in less than seven days after e-filing."
3945,R1HGRHL1PWQFHA,"Not great, not bad","It works pretty well over all. They ding you for an extra $20 for state e-filing, which I don't particularly like, they could be more up front on this. Also, there was a question on how long your dependents lived with you through the year that didn't ""require"" answering, but when I overlooked it, it wouldn't let me file as head of household, so there are some user friendliness issues as well. I was just doing a simple no deductions return and it took me about an hour."
3946,R3ISXBYVVS9T00,"Worked fine for me.","Despite all the negative uproar regarding this year's version of Turbo Tax Deluxe, I had no issues. I'm assuming my personal tax situation allowed me to steer clear of any of the missing forms that others have complained about. Just lucky I guess. I've been doing my taxes with Turbo Tax Deluxe for about 10 years now and so far so good. No issues. Works for me. Easy and quick to use."
3947,R2CG22IG27CRZO,"I would highly recommend Turbo Tax to anyone","This is the fifth year I have used Turbo Tax. It is very user friendly and I always feel confident about using this software in filing my taxes. I even downloaded the Freedom Edition for my daughter and walked her through filing her own taxes for the first time. Before Turbo Tax I did my own taxes by hand and mailed them in. Filing electronically and getting the emails that my taxes were accepted really gives you peace of mind. I would highly recommend Turbo Tax to anyone."
3948,R1F8KEHM0JISDW,"Easy to use","I highly recommend Turbo Tax Deluxe. The software guides the user through the tax filing process, making it easy to use. Each topic may be handled in order, or the user may choose to visit only those items that are applicable. An especially useful feature is the option to click and get additional information if there's a question about the topic presented. I have used Turbo Tax for years because it is simple and accurate."

Not at all impressed by the additional charges and lack of guidance (which I enjoyed for my own tax return) for my daughter's state(s) return which included out-of-state work study earnings (college work-study.,,,,this shouldn't be difficult), which led to 2 state returns, and in the end we abandoned turbotax and did it the old-fashioned way. By hand. Advice...do NOT spend the extra bucks for multi-state returns. Free forms are available on-line!"

3951,R2I5BWXVWDEOC7,"Easy to Use","Very easy to use, I was pleased Turbo Tax lead me through at a very comfortable pace and I believe I received the best refund possible. I also thought the price was reasonable. The only complaint I would have was on the packaging, I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe and the deluxe was in smaller print than the rest of the of the information on the box. I believe it would be better to enlarge this to avoid confusion."

However, I had to call tech support for assistance for ""Job related Expenses"" and for filing state tax returns for two separate states. I had called prior to filing and was given erroneous info. But during the filing process, tech support was able to guide me through both items over the phone!"
3953,R1JLVU6J7GHGJ,"Best Ever!","Best ever! Turbo Tax even calculated my wife's taxable portion of her federal annuity for the first time. Always before, I had to calculate it manually. Got my federal refund in 8 days. I had to answer several identity questions from my Ohio State submittal but then the refund came about two weeks after that. The one critique I have is, why ask me for all the taxable deductions (doctors, medicine, etc.) when it's clear that I'll be taking the standard deduction? Other than that, very pleased"
3954,R2F8YLIL4D7FGX,"So easy to use that a caveman can use it!","Pros: What more is there to say, that hasn't been said alread? I've been using Turbo Tax for the better part of more than 5 years and find the software very user friendly. Every year they make the software easy to use and I doubt very much if I would ever change. Cons: The security breach this year concerned me as you would expect. Hoping this does not affect me and that the guilty are found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law."
3955,R37VSBEE2YB2QU,"Standard deduction","We are retired and for the last 3 or 4 years a standard deduction has turned out to be to our advantage. TurboTax pulls up my last year return and has it as a reference. But I still have to wade through all the deductions and gifts only to be once again told to take a standard deduction. Seems like it should ask if there are any significant changes for last year and if not just take the standard deduction and go with it."

If I didn't like the ease of using ...","This is the first year that Turbo Tax cut the Business forms from their Deluxe edition, and I'm really disappointed. If I didn't like the ease of using Turbo Tax, I'd never buy it again. However, it is a good product, accurate, and easy to use. I'm just bummed that they jacked the price so much to be able to get the necessary forms I need. It's almost to a point where Turbo Tax is out pricing their market. Too BAD!"
3957,RPQDY0WHK3X47,"Turbo Tax is SUPERCHARGED","I have used turbo tax deluxe version for the last 7 years and would not switch to anything else.

Items from the prior year are always filled out for me as well as text items necessary for the state tax return. If I have a question, I can find an answer either within the Turbo Tax product or online with TurboTax. My taxes are filed quickly and correctly. I would recommend this product to everyone...and I do!"
3958,R2MH5C8QLLI6KH,"Should I be getting a bigger refund?","I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years. My tax filing is fairly simple so I thought I would save money and time by using the TurboTax program. From the beginning the program shows your refund. As you input your information the refund indication changes. My problem with this is when I put in my bigger write offs like my mortgage interest the refund indication didn't change. I never found out why. Next year I will have my taxes done elsewhere to see if there is a difference."

Low grade is because of the problems this year."
3960,R13HEF4SD45BZC,"I will keep using TurboTax but Intuit removed some standard ...","I will keep using TurboTax but Intuit removed some standard features from the Deluxe version this year that have been part of the software for many years. Their intent was for individuals to buy Premier vice Deluxe for those features. I suspect there was a lot of backlash, which resulted in ability to upgrade to Premier for free. Need to pay close attention when buying for 2015 taxes. There was one error in the input for the VA state form, but I worked around it using the tax worksheets."
3961,RB7BD0GOP7KU8,"A great product with a little annoince","The program did exactly what it promised. It was easy to use and very fast -- thanks. The only problem is removing the software. The normal process did not remove all directories nor all registry entries. I was forced to reload whole system from a backup image, not a real big deal since I routinely make images, but time consuming and unnecessary. I highly recommend it as long as you are willing to reload from your image backup in order to remove the program fully"

It makes a former chore actually enjoyable. Filing can be like unraveling a complex puzzle but Turbo Tax figures it all out for you. I have several income sources and am primarily on a fixed income. Turbo tax keeps all my information on the income sources, eliminating the need to enter the same info year after year. Anyone can do it although it helps to be organized before you start the process. Well worth the price."
3964,R1VBODC7V0GCZC,"Best of a bad tax system.","The income tax system is too complex. TurboTax gets me through the filing process without having to read volumes of instructions and tax law. I never feel that I understand what I see when I review the final forms. I have trusted TurboTax to get me through the process for many years. So far it has been as good as I could expect given the ridiculous tax system that we have."

Could only get to the point of reviewing the amended return without success in so doing. Not able to print copy of amended form. Filed a paper mailed amended form instead. Am disappointed in not being able to complete the amended return with Turbo Tax. ."
3966,R1IDFBBHDDUXWL,"Good Returns","I have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years. I like how it copies over last year's return info to start a new return. I did my return, my son's who is overseas with the Navy and my sister in law's. I had no trouble as I always use the Deluxe version and don't derive income for exotic sources requiring the Premier Version. I will see you in a year unless someone dumps the IRS. HA!"

The Free State on line is never available and sometimes the program will let one of my friends benefit (I never know when it will ask or let it be free) but this year no one got the benefit, I paid the 19.99 for my personal State tax return."

3969,R3I071AKWWNYFJ,"I have always found the program easy to use","I have used TurboTax for several years. I have always found the program easy to use. The program walks me through the process step by step just in case I have forgotten a deduction. I like the way Turbo Tax transfers all my data to the state return without me having to re-enter the information. I had saved my 2013 information on a flash drive and TurboTax was able to pick up my background date which saved me time entering the information again. All I had to do was verify the date."
3970,RY7XRJMWJOKZH,"CUSTOMER SERVICE ???","Overall the program is tolerable. The problem I had was that one of my IRAs gave me a double distribution which I rolled over and I could not find any way to list it correctly on my return. I'm sure I will have to explain it to the IRS because there is a 1099R showing it as income. After waiting over 30 minutes for CSR help that didn't come, I dummied-up the return to reflect the correct numbers."
3971,R21RKAUO9WT9IZ,"Good but expensive","I've trusted TurboTax for the past 7 years now but its getting more and more difficult to justify doing it myself compared to paying a local company. We live on a border town and my spouse works in another state. $40 more for the additional state plus 2, $19.99 e-file fees along with $50 for the software is just under the cost at a local firm. I really wish they would start offering options that would save money. Sure you can print it and mail the states in and save the $40 but very few users would want to wait."
3972,R3IJQ9Y2JRNKRN,"Very Satisfied with Turbo Tax Deluxe Edition","Although I read that some people were having problems with the on-line version, I purchased my Deluxe edition at Office Depot and had no problems.

Additionally if you need to use more than one state for your return, you have to fork out another 50 bucks for that, and another 20 to efile. I can see the 20 on the free state download. But really, your just stealing money from people when they need another state. The cost is more than the tax software."

This is FALSE ! There are fees with everything you do with this program. If you e-file, you WILL pay a fee of some type to someone using this program. And I did NOT get a return, I still paid in more to both state & federal... Again, it is easy to use. They even offer protection for your return (at $44.95 !)... Just keep that in mind..."

I was so surprised and upset to find when it came time to do the state, I had to pay $39.00 to just do the state part. So that was very disappointing that I had to pay extra. I do trust Turbo Tax and it is easy for me. It was my fault for not examining the container carefully before downloading it; but felt it was a little deceptive of Turbo Tax to make changes without making it clear to the customer."

The only option that I would like is for TT to write to a CD, so if one changes computers you can bring the prior year up via the CD. My computer crashed and I had no back up, well the back up wouldn't work on the new computer. Otherwise, I love Turbo Tax. Valerie Herman"

A relatively easy program that fits my needs perfectly and will very likely return to Turbo Tax next year. I especially like the feature of being able to log on and get updates as to when I can expect my refund. I just hope that in the future any security flaws have been taken care of so I can rest easy about getting hacked."

No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to drop that. Which is just as well, since they charge $19.99 to efile a PA state return???In my opinion, that is just plain stupid. I don't use all the five Federal E-files why can't I have just 1 free state efile? Good software but could be better."
3991,R3E96ZIOGTWVVU,"Problems were solved","I have used Turbo Tax for the past six years. I became very familiar with the program and I like ease of filling in the required information (prompted by the questions). This year everything went smoothly until I went to e-file my returns. I was unable to do so and it was by luck I found Intuit's customer service number. I was on the phone for one and a half hours. The rep was patient and very helpful. I was then able to file my my returns."

It makes it easy to be up to date on the latest tax changes and does it automatically. I liked previous years better than the newest format which I found cumbersome and not as simple to use if a person had some previous tax experience, which I have. Nevertheless, the software is very good and I would use it again."

I ended up doing the MS tax by hand. It was having trouble transferring the 1099 forms from the federal. I went back to check and everything input seemed fine. Also I did not want to itemize on the state return and did not see an option to take the standard deduction."

I had to spend hours trying to identify problems with my City return both of the past 2 years. If I didn't know tax processing as I do, I would have never been able to find the problem.

I find it walks me through every possible deduction and constantly updates itself even after I have filed my taxes.

Turbo Tax beats the other programs by far, the only thing I don't like about Turbo Tax is I can't find the phone number to talk to a live person and that to buy another state costs just as much as I paid for the whole Turbo Tax Deluxe.

I had to manually delete the form."
4010,R2B2BM9TE7AVWX,"Happy User","The software works perfectly and the questions direct an amateur accurately. The successful filing without intimidation is gratifying. The part that does not meet my expectations is that the SC state filing requires $19.95 additional charges even when no taxes are owed.

My only concern is that I forget some of the commands in the time of 12months. Have to try to figure out what some of the commands mean. And the final filing has a lot of precautions before the final key. At times I want to print the page I M working on. Don't find a way to do this.

4022,R3VT9NI6CAWJAQ,"Previous versions of this program are better than this new one","I understand every year something changes with the taxes. Previous versions of this program are better than this new one. Separating the forms is rather taxing and more expensive. The best program that was used was 2011/2012 when all necessary forms were in one version. In the future please take into account that when doing taxes and having to continue to go back and forth and or stop to add and purchase more forms, is inconvenient."

After going to a very well-known tax company and being told I owe over $2000 (never owed in my life and in NO WAY could afford to pay that) and they were charging me $500 to do the taxes, I left my taxes there and picked up a Turbo Tax. I ended up owing a little over $100 and paid only $60 for the Turbo Tax. I feel a tax company doesn't know me and what's going on in my life. Unless they ask all the right questions and I am already a tax expert and know what's important or not tax-wise, they may not get me all of my refund. Doing the taxes myself with the guided Turbo Tax, I feel 100% confident that I am getting all the refund I can. The program asks you questions regarding every situation and depending on whether you answer yes or no, takes you to the next pertinent section. I am middle-class income and Turbo Tax is the only way I will do my taxes. My husband was VERY skeptical! He thought I would not know enough to be able to do the taxes on Turbo Tax. He was worried about taking money out of his 401K and how we would know what to enter regarding that. After seeing how they guide you through EVERYTHING, he is now sold! I recommend Turbo Tax to ALL!

I do my federal taxes and those of my grown kids, so my five free returns are used quickly. I do our state returns using the states free online service to avoid fees. Using the online version turned out to be a shocker when I tried to help my nephew and a friend. Abosolutely free did not apply with one having a 1099 Misc and the other iteminzing with no more than his house and his church tithes. My friend opted to mail his to avoid the fees and my nephew (who is a student with a minimal income), needed his money right away and ended up paying what I thought was a hefty fee to have it deducted from his return (fed only - I used the states service for his state return). I was not happy. These returns were pretty simple, basic returns. My friend at work tried using the online version and and his returns were denied 5 times!! I went thru it for him and could see nothing he'd done wrong. We tried without success to find an on line chat link or a phone number to ask questions. Finally I recreated his return on my program usiing my last free efile to help him out. Why is it so hard to contact you guys? I know you TurboTax has to make some money to support themselves, but I was not ready for this big change and was very disappointed"
4363,R5DGJULYB4EMK,"Price vs value","I've used turbotax for many years, and always valued the product....until now. A product has to be evaluated on its price relative to it's value. It's clear that this year's deluxe version does not fully support schedule D or C as it had in the past. The company says schedule D can be done via using forms, but that is very labor intensive and much more complicated than the previous prompted dialogue method, and the company admits even when that is done it cannot be efiled, so add in the ink, paper and postage to the value equation. I've asked Bob if the 2014 deluxe version can download barter transactions from financial institutions , as the previous version allowed. If so, this would be a big help,That download ability was a value, and itd loss (if lost) would also adversely impact the value equation. It also seems to be pretty clear that full schedule C requires the $99 home and business version--again, another hit to the value proposition of the program, and another inducement to try another product. It is hard then, without a full support for schedule D, and no efiling if you fill the info in via 'forms', and no support for a full schedule C, to justify the price for the upgrades without seriously considering other programs which have retained those features for less price."

If anything has changed in the last year, you are prompted to edit it. There is an easy to understand flow from beginning to end. Anything you are not sure of? You can always go back and address it later. The software will also give you values for any donations you have made throughout the year (clothing and household goods). I look for the new TurboTax every year."

4531,R2B4CPMNS31MUU,"No issues. Previous purchasers can get the free upgrade from Deluxe to Premier ot H&Business.","ok, as previous user of TurboTax for over 15 years. just downloaded Deluxe, but needed the features I always had with Premier. Because I purchased 2013 TurboTax Deluxe, I was able to get a free and simple upgrade to Home & Business because I had a few simple expenses that required those forms which I always had access to before in Deluxe. So Intuit took care of the issue. A lot of negative complaints right now about the lack of the extra forms and the required upgrade expense, but no upgrade expense required if you have purchased last year. Thank you Intuit for taking care of this issue. I don't mind a yearly modest price increase if you want to keep my business, but I hope Intuit learned a lesson about how they rolled out this years new software packages. You have a loyal customer base and you just cant do what you did this year by taking away many functions in the previous Deluxe versions and then asking for an upgrade fee. Your marketing team really needs to learn how to conduct proper customer market research before making these types of changes. But you have fixed it, so hopefully we won't see this big issue again next year. thanks"

4537,R20PU4IL8D7Y65,"H&R Block Deluxe vs Turbo Tax deluxe","I'll be posting this same review for both the TurboTax Deluxe and H&R Block Deluxe products. Like many people I was upset about the changes to the Turbo Tax software but I had already purchased it, then I found out that H&R Block was offering a free download of their sofware to Turbo Tax customers, so I wrote to them and sure enough they gave me a free download, figured I'd give it a shot. I completed my taxes in H&R Block and found that the software was clunky and was not user friendly, the questions were asked in a confusing manner that on multiple occasions left me less than confident of the answers. At this point I should clarify that I have often filled out my taxes long form by hand, majored in finance in college, and actually used to volunteer to do taxes for low income people...so I can say with confidence I generally know what I'm doing with taxes, and to be left dumbfounded on so many of these questions seemed odd to me. On one question I tried the H&R Block chat function, it took 45 minutes to get somebody on the chat, and once I got the guy he didn't actually know anything about the tax form, however I will note that they do TECHNICALLY have people available 24 hours a day unlike TurboTax which only runs until 9pm PST during tax season. So I wrapped up my taxes but I just couldn't shake the feeling that my form wasn't accurate. After thinking it over I decided to bite the bullet and open up TurboTax rather than returning it. The interview process was easy to use as I've come to expect over the years. Also, for some reason, TurboTax ended up getting me a couple hundred dollars more for my return, which I don't really understand since its all pretty simple math, so I went to the forms and it turns out TurboTax had asked about a few more deductions like car registration fees which H&R Block didn't ask about. In the end I continue to be very happy with TurboTax and when it really comes down to it I didn't even need the extra forms that had been removed, but I still think it was pretty crappy of them to remove them."

However, after reading the reviews of H&R Block Deluxe, I discovered that trying to file in two states (and I have to do that) creates difficulty after difficulty and that there is only support after a very long phone wait. So, I chose to stick with Turbo Tax. 3) I chose to give the product 5 stars because it did everything I needed it to do perfectly. However, I would give this company of rating of 0 stars for trying to make an extra buck by screwing over good people. I hope that H&R Block creates a better product that I can use next year."

The worst part for me was deciding which one to buy and I wanted the one with the free ""State"" included free with it but I saw nothing big on box to state this like in the past but I found it. Luckily, the store had it, but from what I read on Amazon, Amazon's was an added cost. Maybe I just didn't see the one that included ""State"" on Amazon as I went by similar pricing instead of searching each one. It was confusing and then once I bought it, I heard about forms that were missing on the Deluxe version and people had to upgrade and then Turbo Tax rectified it and well, it was a big mess for many. Again i got lucky and did not need the forms that were missing. This is why I gave it four stars as the Turbo Tax I purchased worked great for me but way too confusing buying it. Turbo Tax needs to simplify the buyers experience as it has been. I have been a Turbo Tax user since the early 90's and have relied on it. Yes, updates need to happen and that is understandable, but don't take away that was once included and don't confuse consumers with product name changes. if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"

I have one observation tho....this year it well advertised Turbo tax was free in all respects unless you had to have additional tax forms to fill out. I had already purchased my Turbo Tax Deluxe and found when I filed my taxes I had to pay to e-file the State return, $19.00. My return was pretty much simple due to not working but 1/2 of the year. I helped my son and daughter and a close friend to use the ""FREE"" version of Turbo Tax. None of them had to pay to e-file their Fed. or State returns. My friend had extra forms to fill out for income from a 401-K and also for his Social Security. He did not have to pay anything to file his State either. What is up with that? So let me get this straight, if I purchase my Deluxe program, $48.00, I will still need to pay to e-file my state. That's a total of $67.00. Then everyone else get's to e-file all for ""FREE""!

The program can be used by 5 individual filers and you get one free eFile. This year the products have changed. There is still the basic program but the deluxe program only includes simple investment and no rental properties. There is now a third program for involved tax situations. It should be noted that the basic program does not include the state tax filing forms. Most people will use the deluxe program. Turbo tax works well for businesses as well as individuals.

The thing is, I don't have a terribly complicated tax situation; otherwise I wouldn't be using a DIY product because frankly, I'm not that bright and I find most tax stuff about as clear as peace in the Middle East.

I do not know why I worried for 2 weeks wondering if it would go though. It was so thorough with me and If I had any questions I was able to click on the blue highlighted word and get more of an explanation of what was expected and what the law was. I am completely happy with turbo tax and yes I will buy it again next year.! I am not even good at math but they do all that for me. I would recommend it to everyone."

My returns (both Federal and State) are already in the bank. There were some bad press because Intuit moved some features to the more expensive version but it didn't affect me this year. They should have been more upfront about the changes they made, but they did offer me a rebate if I had needed the more expensive version. It wasn't a problem in my case, but you should pay attention if you have more complex tax returns."

This year's version is pretty good, but it still has a few places where one is left scratching one's head. It does not do a good job of leading one step-by-step through dealing with farm income. The Oregon State return fails to account for the portion of military retirement income that is non-taxable (although the 2014 version came closer to doing this than any previous version, so there is at least some progress)."

It naturally took some time, but as we progressed through the modules, more confidence was gained with the completion of each set. The results were outstanding. Familiarity the last two years has caused presentation time to be greatly diminished, which actually made doing taxes a pleasue instead of a huge drag. Thank you Intuit for the lucid mode of tax preparation, which even ""non-geeks"" can usefully employ and feel complete security of application."

It simply is NOT as easy as before, and very hard to find where you left off during your work. And even though I used the same computer as last year the program could NOT find last years data. Why? But the program does find all your legal deductions and does a great job of figuring out retirement funds/programs. I will use Turbo Tax next year, hope they go back to the 2012 format."

I do realize there was controversy this year due to TurboTax's altering the various forms available in Deluxe (I only need Schedules A and B and so was unaffected by the changes), but based on emails they've sent to users, it seems they've done the right thing and rectified the situation. All in all, I give TurboTax an ""A""; it's easy to navigate and, most importantly, it's accurate. Highly recommended."

Once TurboTax offered the free upgrade to Premier if you used TurboTax last year (which I did), I immediately bought TurboTax Deluxe and once my files were transferred from last year, TurboTax noted that I needed Premier to file the same forms and the free automatic upgrade was quick and easy.

I think the cost of the state return should be included in the price rather than having to pay extra when you are ready to file. This year I did my granddaughter's return using Freedom TurboTax. I was very pleased to be able to get the federal and state return on the same site and that it was free. I tried other programs, but I think TurboTax is the best."

I think that Turbo Tax made a bad mistake by shuffling the different schedules in the packages they have been selling for years. This was obviously a ploy to make people upgrade to the next level. It is not so bad that they changed their marketing plan, but the way they did it. It's like buying a Ford Mustang every 5 years and then this year you buy a new one and before you can drive it off the showroom floor, they tell you that you have to upgrade to the next model if you want an engine with the car."

I would suggest that when the returns are partially complete--say 25%, 50% and 75%--that you are able to review your input rather than waiting until the end.

Not only did they address my issue to my satisfaction, they took full responsibility for their error and sincerely apologized for the issue.

Why can't a business just be transparent and say we are going to increase the price of our product rather than the sneaky and underhanded approach they tried this year? HOWEVER, Intuit's decision to do the free upgrade and the ease of completing the upgrade moves the stars from 1 -> 3. This process went very smoothly. I would like to continue to use TurboTax in the future, but will decide next year when I see pricing and features, including the Amazon Bonus for Rebates, which can be a nice benefit if I have a significant refund."

It was great to get a good price and with the download I didn't need to go to the store. I've always been a little disappointed with the state software as those who have used Turbo Tax can attest. While the federal software is full featured with good explanations and guidance, the state process is the Plain-Jane stepchild. The numbers and calculations all work smoothly, but it would be nice to get a little more value in that part of the package. I especially like the seamless ""It's Deductible"" app for valuing contributions of used clothing and home goods."

6238,R16JMS2ILTMHNE,"READ THE UPDATE! Long time TT user retreated from jumping ship to HRB and ended up having a trouble free time with TT2014","UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE I've changed my rating from four to five stars. You'll just have to read all the comments to find out why. Make sure that you read some of the (currently) well over 2000 1 star reviews as well, as this review reflects my particular experience. Many others did not fare as well as I have and have quite legitimate complaints! UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE As a long time user (13 years... 17 years - I dunno), I was surprised to see the abysmal rating when I went to order TT2014 in late January. I read a bunch of the reviews about the utterly boneheaded, clueless and clumsy move by Intuit (which I won't reiterate for what would be the 2000th time). Decided to check back after the date when Intuit was going to provide the free upgrade for previous years Premiere customers and also spent some time reading reviews about HRB. So... few days ago came back read a bunch more reviews for both products and, after reading enough reviews for HRB where some former TT users were not particularly thrilled with the ease of use of HRB, as well as the various financial incentives that worked for me ($20 off of Norton Security software, which I needed and the somewhat strange offer for an additional 10% kicked in for any part of the refund designated for an Amazon gift card) and made the price difference disappear, I opted for TT. Unlike some others, who had problems getting the free upgrade, filing electronically, and other miscellaneous complaints, I had no problem whatsoever. Filed a 1040 with itemized deductions, some capital gains to report, some IRA dollars to report, some tax break for student loan payments - that is to say, not the simplest return although not particularly complex. Complete the federal using the electronic filing option without a problem. Completed the state form too, and opted to mail it in. I'm in no rush to pay the state the bit of money that I owe them and certainly did not want to pay the $19.99 state filing fee (which is not a fee for using the Turbo Tax state tax preparation option), so will be printing out and mailing those forms. Unlike some of the TT and HRB drones either writing reviews or commenting on reviews, I am an actual, honest to goodness consumer with a few reviews under my belt. While I think that Intuit really made a mess of things and in the process ended up infuriating and losing a lot of customers, they made enough corrections and provided enough financial incentives to lure me back from the precipice. In the end, I had no complaints or problems with the product and the net price after taking into account the assortment of financial discounts and incentives, was significantly less expensive than HRB. I knocked off one star because Intuit simply didn't deserve 5 stars in light of their profoundly stupid business decision. I'll try to respond to what I deem to be any legitimate comments and will completely ignore any comments that I deem to be from TT or HRB drones."

They still asked for the Tax ID number several times.This should not have been asked. Also today I received a phone call from someone saying they were from the IRS saying they were trying to contact me as the IRS was going to sue me. They gave me a phone number to call and then hung up. I did not call the number, and am sorry I did not write it down right away. Sounds like some kind of scam going on."

This change was made to optimize revenue, plain and simple. That's their prerogative, they're a business after all. Bob Meighan is a great guy but it's job to sell the public on these types of business decisions. There are plenty of other options, some better in my opinion. Checkout Common Form or TaxAct.

I finally had to use MY COMPUTER and after a few try's got it to load. the desktop icon is just a green square which could be a glitch and between everything makes me not trust the validity of the disk. the interview is terrible compared to TT and a major flaw I found that in putting in a social security 1099 it doesn't ask you for the Medicare amounts paid and doesn't pinpoint it at any part of the interview even when you get to medical insurance in the schedule A. I found the interview overall extremely lacking. the forms view truly sucks and they incorporate worksheets into the form making too much clutter and confusion. going back to TT since intuit is making good on their screw up.

6741,R1EE9DHZF9ZC9V,"Works fine--a couple of minor gotchas, but it works fine.","It works fine. I had some things happen when I'd leave the program and restart it later ""at the same place"" that were a little tricky, particularly when I'd finished, but before I'd e-filed, then discovered a change I needed to make. The interface LOOKED like it wanted me to buy the state download a second time. I clicked ""Buy"" and it skipped right to where I wanted to be. But that minor user interface issue aside, I had the usual reasonable experience with Turbo Tax. By downloading it from Amazon.com, I got a special offer to get 10% bonus on a portion of my refund in Amazon gift cards. So, I chose to get $200 of my refund that way so that the $20 bonus would cover the cost of filing my state refund. My refund is pretty simple--so the Deluxe worked for me. If I had investments and a few other relatively common things, I think I would have had to upgrade to a more expensive version. It is important to review your tax needs BEFORE you select a version of TurboTax this year. Bottom line: It's fine. About the 10th or 11th time I've used TurboTax."

I finally called TurboTax support and talked to a live person (would you believe a live person??). However this live person knew absolutely nothing about my installation problem. Finally he said, ""I'll transfer you to tech support...."" I waited and waited and waited.....no tech support. I hung up and tried the live person routine again. This time another agent seemed more helpful with several suggestions....none worked. He, too, said, ""hang on, I'll transfer you to tech support,"" I could hear him asking around for the tech support number, then some muffled voices, then the phone went dead. He lost me (after more than an hour on the phone!!) I never got the problem resolved. I crossed my fingers and tried to install TurboTax on my laptop and voila, it worked.

I'll use no other program. I see there was a lot of angry customers due to the changes in the Deluxe version this year. Rightly so, but at least Intuit made amends for that poor decision. If I ever need to upgrade from Deluxe, I'll do so without hesitation. And by the way, one of my returns was questioned by the IRS and they demanded a large portion of my Federal refund be returned. I obliged and immediately contacted Turbo Tax quality control satisfaction team about the discrepancy. I forwarded the Turbo Tax response via email to the IRS and within three weeks the IRS returned my money (in full) with interest! How many tax paying citizens can say that? The IRS made the mistake, not Turbo Tax. Had I done my taxes without Turbo Tax and their stellar support, I would never have known the IRS form was inaccurate. I'm a Turbo Tax customer for life!"

If I don't have the specific information ""right there"", I can just skip it and enter it later. (Now you can't do THAT with one of those ""bring everything now"" tax preparation companies!) I will never pay $400+ again to have an ""expert"" calculate my taxes. Try $40, and I know that everything was done _perfectly_ so that nothing was missed. Saves me big-time, and I don't overpay my tax anymore. Like I said: ""Huge Fan!"" Thanks, TurboTax."

6971,R1WBYCVNF1H0M7,"A great tax filing software, handicapped by the greed of the publisher.","UPDATE: Thanks to the first comment on my review, I noticed that I had forgotten to mention, in my review, that I did switch away from TurboTax to H&R Block's Tax Software, this year, owing mostly to this 'holding for ransom' policy they adopted. I haven't tested that software yet but I'm not worried. I'll write that review after I've used it. About the price hike: I understand that companies have to do what is good for their bottom line but I can't imagine that selling so many millions of copies of TurboTax does not bring in enough revenue to maintain a quality product. But there is only so much that can be said about this considering price gouging is almost becoming a trend. TurboTax Deluxe has always been priced around $50 and I've been able to buy it, always, between $29-$39, on sale. If Intuit had enclosed a warning in last year's release, about an upcoming price increase, I probably wouldn't even have flinched and paid their price hike, without any problem. But to simply reduce functionality of Schedules C, D, etc, under the guise of ""consistency with online products"" is low. I don't know their online products, never used them, don't care about them, don't care about inconsistency between online and desktop products. So it felt it to be a nasty surprise when I read that those forms were reduced in functionality pending a ransom of another $30-$40. This dislike is reflected in my star rating of 3/5. I still can't imagine giving this product a rating lower than that because it is remarkable in what it does, year in and year out. Software: I've been using TurboTax since it was not even an Intuit product, back in early 90's and it would be easy for me to say that it is a very solid product. Around 2005, I tried to use a competing product and I found it very crude compared to TurboTax so I went back to TurboTax. Features I found very useful: 1. Flawless importing of prior year's data 2. The interview process 3. Direct access to forms 4. Override warnings and auto calculated fields 5. Ability to switch between forms and interview, seamlessly and without losing anything 6. Importing W-2, 1098 and a couple of other forms is very helpful 7. Auditing feature is very reassuring 8. Electronic filing is big help and makes for fast refund 9. Ability to save archives in PDF"

When I first started looking in December, I was pretty disappointed and like many others started looking at alternatives. Then I got the first email from Intuit stating I would get a $25 discount. I thought that was ok, but for my situation, didn't really cover it. I wasn't convinced. Then, I got the second email in which they basically apologized for not thinking this through and not realizing the impact it had. They let me know that I would have access to whatever I needed. I've been a TurboTax user for about 15 years. I went ahead again this year and bought the same one as always. Here's what I can tell you: It is as awesome as always! When it hit the first ""you need to upgrade"" message, it was for $0 dollars and only took 30 seconds to upgrade. Same for the second. So I got everything I needed for my Schedule C and more in the Deluxe version. It's unfortunate that Intuit made this bad decision, but let's be realistic - mistakes happen. I'm impressed that they realized their mistake and fixed it. There are a lot of bad reviews about this - look at the date. If they are before Feb 7, then they aren't current. Look at the responses to those and you will see the real story from Intuit/Turbo Tax."

7235,R12PI9QC6DJGQD,"I personally HIGHLY recommend using TurboTax for filing your Federal and State Income Tax.","I have been using TurboTax since 2011 when the Federal mandated that all IRS Income Tax's be filed electronically. The first time was somewhat hard to use; however, the key to my success, was letting TurboTax walk you through from the beginning to the end. I have progressed to where I just go to the portions and enter the data as I get it. I have always filed my Taxes long hand; however, when I began using TurboTax Deluxe, I found that I had been missing several deductions. By utilizing TurboTax, my refunds have gone up dramitically. The key is to keep all receipts, charitable givings, medical costs, clothing costs, Milage to the doctor's offices, taxes paid on your property and the cost for your vehicle inspections. Last year I filed for my older brother where he use to have to wait for the senior citizens to give him a date to file his. I will also do them for him this year. My neighbors came down and I helped them with filing their taxes this year and got a good income back and they plan on doing the same next year. Up to five different parties can file their Income taxes on 1 years purchase of TurboTax. Also if you have any questions, you can call them. TurboTax even gives you at the end of entering Federal and State's information, the chance of being audited. It notifies you when the Federal gets your submission and when they accept it. You can't go wrong using TurboTax programs. I am very well pleased with their results. And while I'm at it......NO....I'm not being paid or compensated for typing up this review. I highly recommend TurboTax to use in filing your Federal and State returns. Charles in WV."

I've always counted on Turbo Tax for my preparation and actually made an early purchase this year in preparation for my 2014 return. Shame on me for assuming that the same product I have used for years (Deluxe) for my scenarios of K-1 and 1099s now has those capabilities LOCKED! I know there were other versions of the product (e.g. Home & Biz and Premier) that offered additional guidance, but I did not require those features; I just needed the forms. I can't believe such a drastic change has been made to force me into spending double on a product when history proved that the original product was fully capable of handling my needs. I feel cheated and blackmailed. I think it's time to explore other options! EDIT: I have revised my rating and review due to how Intuit resolved my issue. It seems they have heard our issues and concerns loud and clear and, after calling the number provided here by the Intuit VP 800-445-1875 (8am - 8pm EST M-F), they immediately upgraded me to the version that would best meet my needs. I understand that mistakes happen and, for me, it's all about how someone tries to resolve that mistake. I am very please with the resolution, but certainly hope that Intuit has learned from this mistake and makes sure they don't repeat it next year."

After all the hoopla about the error the company made, I think it is a good idea to take a breath and reflect on (1) the quality of the software and (2) Intuit as a company. After I did, I decided to stay and continue to use TurboTax. 1. The software's quality doesn't seem to be an issue here. Most believe it is an accurate and easy way to file taxes. I was tempted to switch but didn't see the competitor software as a realistic alternative. Given that I've used TurboTax since the first year it was offered, I'm not likely to jump into using a competitor's product out of anger. 2. Intuit did do something surprising and upsetting here, but it certainly appears that they have realized their mistake and completely fixed it. How many companies admit their error and then reverse their decisions? I don't remember any previous issues, so I'm not sure why this is their second strike. Sure, I'd like the pricing to stay the same, but as I expect salary increases each year, I also expect others to do so as well in the form of higher prices for some products. I see that isn't the issue, though. It's one of trusting the company after they tried to change the product names. I agree that they pulled a serious mistake and they have already admitted that and offered to reset everything for this year as well as future years. I don't know what else they can do to make people feel better. I'm guessing those who are responsible for this will be penalized, and the corporate world most often relieves them of duty. Who will remain? Those who had nothing to do with this decision, and who probably disagreed with the direction of things. There are lots of user-oriented people at Intuit, and their interface is quite polished. I'm not sure it's the best idea to jump ship to what others have said to be an inferior product (but I do not have experience with it). We have actually benefited from this problem, as the pricing has not increased. Intuit has already suffered greatly from this debacle, but I don't think it's necessary to take out our vitriol on every employee in the firm. It's also short-sighted if the competitor's product is not as good. Some manager or committee made a stupid decision, and I'm sure they are already either gone or marginalized. I don't feel the need to punish the entire company because of one bone-headed leader who is probably already gone (hopefully). So I'm sticking with TurboTax, as it has served me so well over the last few decades. Ok, Intuit, you're on notice to keep things (1) clear and straightforward and (2) working well."

7360,R1SODFI7ROC2J7,"Intuit's Official Position","Here's Intuit's official message to their former customers... Dear So and So, We messed up. We made a change this year to TurboTax desktop software and we didn't do enough to communicate this change to you as proactively and broadly as we could or should have. I am very sorry for the anger and frustration we may have caused you. Intuit has a long history of doing right by our customers, and in this instance, we did not live up to the standards of excellence you have come to expect from us. We did not handle this change in a manner that respected our loyal customers and we owe you an explanation of what we are doing to make it right. The change we made to our desktop products, both the download and CD versions, includes removing Schedules C, D, E and F from TurboTax Deluxe, which some long-time customers had relied on to report business income, investment sales and rental property income. As a result, you may now be required to upgrade the version of TurboTax you use even though your tax situation hasn't changed from last year. Here's why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line. So this year, we made the product experience consistent across all TurboTax offerings. This change enables us to innovate faster and make improvements that benefit all customers at the same time, regardless of whether they use our online or desktop software. You can be sure that we've preserved what's unique to our desktop product: the ability to e-file up to five returns, switch to forms mode and install the software on multiple computers. Find the TurboTax product that's right for you. But good intent must be matched with great execution, and that is where we let you down. We have heard from many of you that you were surprised when you discovered the change. No one likes this kind of a surprise, so we are taking immediate action to make things right and help you through this transition year. We are giving $25 back if you purchased TurboTax Deluxe desktop software (CD or download) and filed your 2013 tax return and have to upgrade to TurboTax Premier or Home & Business to file your 2014 return. This will help you move to the right desktop product, while reducing the immediate and unexpected financial impact. After completing and filing your return this year, request your $25 here. I deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this change. Our customers are the heartbeat of every TurboTax employee. Our hope is that we can regain your trust and demonstrate that our commitment to you has never been stronger. Sincerely, Sasan Goodarzi and the TurboTax Team General Manager, Intuit TurboTax"

It transfers previous years' information (if you used Turbo Tax last year) and builds on it to complete the current return. The program walks you through, step by step, and helps you determine what deductions are applicable to your return, and lets you know when a standard deduction would be to your advantage. If you get interrupted, you can easily pick up where you left off or backtrack to make corrections. Electronic filing of federal taxes is included at no charge. Now, if someone could persuade California to stop gouging $20 to accept E-filing, (something that I'm sure saves the state as much time and money as it does the taxpayer) the process would be that much better."

We filed early this year (in January) and within 24 hours we received a message that our returns had been approved by the State and the Feds. Three weeks later we had our tax returns which is unheard of. Would advise any user to have all their information organized in categories which makes it easer to enter all the required information and much less frustrating. In another respect, TurboTax is especially helpful when it comes to providing acceptable deductible amounts for non-cash charitable donations, such as Goodwill, books donated to the library, etc. TurboTax also gives you some idea if your returns might result in auditing. Would definitely rate it in the 5 star category. What more can I say?"

All I had to do was transfer my 2013 taxes from my saved 2013 turbo tax record, used the down load feature to get my w2 information, enter some additional information (mortgage, property taxes, etc.) and in about an hour I was finished. It costs 50 dollars for the software and an additional 20 dollars to e-file the state taxes (federal is free) but the time saved easily covers the cost.

My biggest issue with this years version was the help page and the lack of communication with customers on the part of Turbo Tax. The help page takes you to comments made by other customers and it was tedious at best to try to find an answer to my problem. Calling their toll free number wasn't any help either. Finally after several trips to the help page i found out the reason for my problems with the state returns is that the forms haven't been given final approval by the state(Ohio). This person posted that a list of states that had yet to approve the forms. This information could have and should have been provided when I downloaded the state program. Couple this with their changes in the Deluxe version that blind sided long time users i think they need to examine their communications with customers and revise their help procedures."

It didn't make a hoot of difference to us- but I empathized with all those who felt cheated and duped. So- I bought the H&R Block software in support. The software was fairly easy- a user friendly approach like TT. But, a questionable result had me wondering if I should have stayed with TT. So- I bit the bullet and bought TT afterall. There must have been some tax changes- because I came up with a very similar outcome. All that to say- that I've used both and find TT the better of the two. It was more user friendly- the questions were worded better- and the index was helpful so that I could skip areas that I didn't need to input. We only needed the schedule A and all the deduction finders... but can still understand why so many were upset. However, for us- TT did the job well, with little fuss and will still be our tax software of choice."

When I filed for tax year 2014, Turbox taxed asked what was my ""actual state tax refund received"". Turbox tax should not let the user enter any other amount for state tax refund other than that claimed on the federal return that generates a benefit that reduces federal taxes. Turbox tax let me change the amount, and when my 1099 G did finally arrive, it was for the gross amount and not the amount actually received.

However, after spending 30 minutes entering information I learned that because I received a state refund last year and itemized I'd need to upgrade. I decided to use this version because I've been using TurboTax since 2007 and the download version included the state filing documents. I was able to complete the filing process in less than an hour so no complaints there. I wish the state efiling had been included though. Seems foolish to have to pay to electronically file in 2015.

I did their little quiz on what applies to you... they said buy deluxe. Bought deluxe, downloaded deluxe. Already paid $10 (25%) more than last year for the deluxe. Turns out selling a home is an investment (Sch. D). So now they want me to upgrade for $30, only it's not working. And that's significantly more than the price difference here (currently 52% more cost to upgrade via them than the price difference between premier and deluxe on here.) Update: Upon reflection and researching this issue: I don't need the now recommended upgrade for the sale of the home. I didn't make enough ""profit"" (250k single, 500k married) to make it taxable, but they wanted me to upgrade so that I could enter the information then not submit it anyway... which would have charged me extra to tell me that they didn't really need to charge me extra after all. 2nd Update: Due to extremely good customer service response, I'm upgrading my rating to 4*. I think there is a better way to do the upgrades, but since they are being proactive with support and follow-ups, it's not a completely bad situation. The product has flaws, but they are actively trying to handle the issues."

7688,R2NW95ZWJTQ8E7,"Intuit caved! Expect Free Upgrade To Premium or Free H&R Block. Amazon Gift Card Deal Gives TurboTax a Good Advantage.","EDIT: *** Intuit recently announced that they're caving and just offering every returning Deluxe customer a free upgrade, then reintroducing the old included features for next year. However, the deal isn't active as of the date of this edit. H&R Block has also offered to give you their competing software for FREE with proof of TurboTax Deluxe purchase. Google ""SwitchToBlock"" for detail. *** Many people are (understandably) upset that Intuit removed features from Deluxe for certain schedule C and D filers. I agree that was a bad move, but in Intuit's defense, they offer a $25 refund for a $30 upgrade to Premium for Deluxe buyers who used Deluxe last year if you call 800-445-1875 and explain your situation. Also, it's a better deal than people are giving it credit for, plus support is America-based and actually pretty helpful (I'll explain my experience with them below). At present, the Deluxe with Fed + State is $38, BUT you're eligible to receive a 10% bonus on every $100 you apply to an Amazon gift card (up to $10,000 of gift cards). That means that if you shop on Amazon a lot, or want to buy a TV with your refund or something, then all you have to do is use $400 of your refund on Amazon gift cards and this software pays for itself. Many are suggesting switching to H&R Block Tax Cut, but just be aware that they don't have the same deal with Amazon gift cards so there may be a financial trade-off with the decision if you're a frequent Amazon shopper. That said, H&R Block DOES have a 10% gift card bonus program for 40 vendors like Target and Best Buy, so they're still a good alternative to consider if you frequent H&R Block's participating stores. As far as TurboTax support goes, they were great to me! I accidentally bought the version of this without state (big mistake on my part because Intuit will normally charge you $40 to buy the a la carte state download). At first I was frustrated because I didn't realize what I was buying (or that they even made a version without state), but: 1. They apparently have a 60-day money back guarantee where they'll send you a refund if you send them your purchase confirmation. -and- 2. I thought that would be a pain because of all the bureaucracy, delay and snail-mail involved, so I called support and they were nice enough to let me buy my state for only $9, which was the price difference between what I mistakenly bought and what I meant to buy. In short, I understand many reviewers' frustration, but it seems like Intuit really is trying to take care of their customers, so I thought I'd try to give them a little love in light of all the negative reviews."

Compared to the amount of money I was being 'gouged' for by a CPA, changing over to TurboTax was a dream come true. Getting charged an extra 20 bucks for an upgrade?

I gave it 3 stars because I think the way they bill for states is exorbitant. I live in one state and work in another so this means I have to file in both states (not all states are this way but mine is).

This nearly caused me to purchase the H&R Block software. But I called Intuit and they gave me a nice discount on TurboTax Home & Business, which by the way, is the version you need if you are self-employed and you sell stocks from time to time. The Deluxe version was sufficient for that purpose in years past, but apparently not anymore. Yes, you can fill out the forms for Schedule C and D manually and then mail your return with Deluxe, but why would I need software to do that? Preposterous! The discount I received keeps me with TurboTax for another year, and I will wait and see what the fall-out is from this new pricing of their products, with fewer features in the Deluxe version.

7742,R26GUGEDS8XB0R,"Turbo Tax is the best!","I absolutely prefer Turbo Tax over H&R Block software. The software is much clearer to use and the prompts are very helpful. I was upset that Intuit decided to exclude schedules C and D this year and so had purchased H&R Block's software. H&R Block had more difficulty with my minister's housing allowance so I relented and purchased Turbo Tax 2014. It handled my housing allowance just fine as it has all the past years I've used it. I don't use schedules C or D so that feature removal didn't impact me. I definitely prefer and recommend Turbo Tax over H&R Block. I haven't used Taxcut so I can't speak to it. An Addendum: I've been a minister for some 30 years and have always done my taxes and have never been audited, knock on wood. Because of this I have tried to stay on top of tax filing requirements for ministers. As any minister knows filing taxes as a minister is pretty complex and requires a multitude of forms and actions that many ministers cannot follow, that a non-minister cannot understand, and that many tax professionals have difficulty with, if one is to satisfy IRS requirements which is a moving target. I offered a synopsis of my experience with H&R Block's software versus Turbo Tax. I did not list every detail for brevity and because I'm not going to put all ""my business on the street"". My opinion, subjective by definition, is that Turbo Tax does a better job of handling all the ins and outs of a minister's return and does it more smoothly with better explanations. Take it for what it's worth. It's but one man's opinion."
7743,R1PVEMKR1LH99E,"Turbo Tax Still Rules","Despite the negative reviews posted regarding the attempt by TT to get more $$ for the same services previously provided, I just purchased it again. And I have to say...So? What's your point? Every single company is in business to make $$...why disparage a company for doing what its goal is? Do you believe the company you work for doesn't want to increase its own revenues, and isn't trying every day to figure out a way to do that? I've used TT ever since I can remember, and OMG, it has made the chore of doing our taxes incredibly easy!! I am sure they have had some price increases in the past 10 years, but I can't remember any recently. The other point the critics use is that they tried to get people to buy their more expensive product. Again, no different than ANY OTHER business. When you're buying anything from replacement windows to landscaping to a trip to Disney World, all the good salesmen try to get you to upgrade (i.e., spend MORE money) from their lower-priced items. Hasn't anyone noticed the sneaky way food companies (I won't name any names, but if you shop for groceries you've noticed who they are) reduce the amount of product in their packages, but charge the same price they did for the previous-sized products? The fact that the VP of Turbo Tax has issued numerous apologies, AND is recompensing its customers if they purchased the more expensive version, is amazing to me. I could write a book the length of War and Peace on the number of companies who NEVER EVEN RESPONDED to an email or letter mailed I DIRECTLY to their Customer Service Departments, or, in some cases, their company President or VP. I commend Turbo Tax for admitting their mistakes, and rectifying them as best they can. TT is still the best tax-preparation software out there. (I can say that with firm conviction, because I work with several CPAs who prepare personal and corporate taxes for a living, and they all recommended TT to me years ago, and still use it themselves. I have never regretted their recommendation.)"

I have been using TT since the early 90s. TT Deluxe has been ~$45 dollars for at least 5 years on Amazon. What other software can you say has had no other increases in that time? Its just like a candy bar or coffee. Do you charge more for the same size or reduce the size. Have you purchased one of those 13 oz. pounds of coffee lately. I wish they had kept the features the same and added $5 dollars and most would understand. But to have to go to Premier for a $30 increase in one year is a lot. I knows the laws on Sch C, D, and E are getting more complicated every year and they got to pay for those greedy IT staffers (I was one for 40 years) but $30 at once is a bunch.

I have been a loyal customer since 1990. I understand that there may be corporate needs for change, but change can be hard to accept, especially when neither anticipated nor solicited. So my satisfaction continues on at least until next year. I hope that some adjustments could be made such as restoring the features of the original Deluxe product for perhaps a reasonable fee increase. For that matter, Deluxe and Premium could be merged into one and dropping some of the lesser utilized features of Premier, such as free phone consultation. Also, limitations of functionality for schedule C or miscellaneous business income previously available in Deluxe but not even available in Premier should also be restored as this seems generally more useful for income outside the usual employee relationship. I've always been extremely satisfied with the TurboTax product that I understood I was getting. In its zeal to appeal to some customers for a consistent product across multiple platforms, the basic consistency of its main product was potentially compromised. Mr Meighan quite satisfactorily handled that problem. I'm hopeful the larger problem will be resolved for next year. I'm willing to renew my commitment to Turbotax."

I will buy the Turbotax Deluxe with State Product...and will report back with my findings. Paticulars, I'm retired military and now a Federal Government Employee, homeowner..and as I said before I have no business income to report. For now I will leave Turbotax a ""5"" rating for how their representative provided me with excellent service."

Had no technical issues or hiccups. I chose the download copy, which worked without me having to struggle to get it to work. I was able to do our taxes in under an hour, state and federal. Although, you do have to pay to use the program to use it to file state taxes ($20). I compare this service to paying a ""tax prep professional"" to do my taxes in terms of value. When I look at it this way, I come out ahead. If you are looking for real value and savings, your best bet is to take a few courses on tax prep. Other option is to read the product description, which I found greatly helpful."
7830,R2IZW5PGDBLZUW,"Some reasons to stay with TurboTax","Yes, TurboTax has made a big mistake deleting some important features from the Deluxe version. Fortunately I don't need those features so I am still very happy with TurboTax. Since H&R Block is offering a free download for those who are unhappy I decided to give it a try. In my opinion it is not as user friendly as TurboTax. If you just need to fill out a few forms it is a real mess essentially requiring you to go through the step by step process. Even with that process it is not friendly. Two examples: 1) if you have more than 3 real estate tax payments to include you either have to add them up manually or go to the full (not mini) form in order to list the items/amounts for a total. 2) If you have several sources of medical premiums to include its the same deal, add manually or go to the full form to list all items. Not a big deal but if you are used to TurboTax you will quickly be frustrated with H&R Block."

Was able to use Deluxe in recent times and was alarmed by what many of you were experiencing. I did reach out to Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, and he is offering a satisfactory solution for at least this tax year. I'll take it rather than take a shot with H & R. Don't want to cut off my nose to spite my face. I just hope that your reviews force TurboTax to rectify this problem for 2015 and beyond. If not, H & R Block, EA's, and CPA's will be smiling to the bank... By the way, I don't work for TurboTax nor have any interest other than to get my taxes done accurately this year at a reasonable cost. Don't kill the messenger!!!"
7842,R2QKMY3VEF4FK4,"Works for Me, Year After Year!","As a TurboTax and Quicken user since the days of floppy disks, I would like to offer my opinion of this year's TurboTax program, and all the negative comments. Over the years, my tax situation has varied widely, from paying BIG money for an accountant to be sure that I had filed everything correctly, to years where my situation was simple enough to be able to file the short form. The first year I tried TurboTax, I ran the program parallel to and in addition to having my taxes prepared by a certified tax CPA. That was very educational. This was before such a thing as E-File. The forms that each generated were equally professional, the figures functionally identical, but the tax preparation costs were wildly different. Since then, I have used TurboTax exclusively, and will use it again this year, assured that it will do the job efficiently and inexpensively, at around 20% of the cost of a CPA. Over the years I have, of course, seen the program evolve and change in a myriad of ways. I believe that the human interface has improved, the ""interview"" process become more inclusive, and the overall design has improved almost every year. I have also seen the cost of the program vary due to special offers, rebates, coupons, and plain price changes. No matter what, though, I have always considered it a bargain. This year's TT installed flawlessly, updated itself on the first boot, and, with my permission, found and imported last year's information to reduce the amount of repetitive form filling. I began the ""interview"" process to plug in some preliminary data to get some estimates, and was pleased to see that it would still allow me to create multiple returns to allow me to test various scenarios before the receipt of my EOY statements. I expect that the program will serve its purpose again this year with a minimum of fuss and trouble based on my past and present experience. I see that many people have chosen to post a negative review because of the decision to change that capability of the program regarding stock transactions. Apparently, they consider it an unfair reduction of functionality and choose to condemn the whole program because of this one change. They speak as if someone took something away from them that they somehow expected or deserved. But, by its nature, TurboTax is a single purpose, one time use program. It does your taxes for the current tax year, and then it is ostensibly useless. It's implied that if you want to use it next year, you have to buy the new model. This year, the manufacturer has chosen to re-align the features available in that new model. Car manufacturers change their list of ""standard equipment"" annually. MS Office drops and adds features constantly. This is not as if your copy of Office suddenly stopped opening spreadsheets without warning. Your car is worn out. You used it up. Now you have to go into the showroom and shop this year's offerings. If the fact that they dropped the ""standard"" back up camera and made it optional is a deal breaker, then you have other choices. They may or may not be better than the new model of the car you are already comfortably familiar with sans back up camera. You need to decide, but the change in this one feature doesn't make the whole car a pile of crap. In any event, TurboTax works perfectly for me, and has done year after year. I expect that it will do so again this year. It has saved me thousands of dollars in CPA fees and surely saved my sanity trying to decipher the obscure tax laws and annual changes. Do I WANT to spend more for a feature that used to be included and is now an option? Of course not; no one does. But, WOULD I? Without a doubt, because the functionality, accuracy, and familiarity are worth it to me."

TurboTax has always been helpful whenever I have had a problem, especially Bob Meighan, their Turbotax VP. I will continue to be a TurboTax user, and if it costs a few more dollars than the previous year, it is still a bargain. Try doing your taxes without a tax program, and you will soon find out.

I buy and sell stocks each year, and was concerned about the change this year requiring TurboTax Premier instead of Deluxe to include stock sales as part of the interview process. Bob Meighan (VP, TurboTax), who posted an open review for this product, was extremely helpful and attentive in explaining Intuit's reasoning for their decision. He turned my doubts around. I am a recently retired software and systems engineer. While employed, I would often hold my perception of TurboTax software model up as an example for my aerospace employer to follow.

Completed first draft immediately and can now better strategize when to file and how to structure taxes for coming year.

7850,R2H72HLQN051I8,"Still a good deal","I have used Turbotax for decades. While I don't accept the stated reasons for the new 2014 packaging (such as transparency), the base price has been relatively stagnant, and it remains a good value, particularly considering the upgrades that have been made over the years. The market will decide, of course, but I haven't found that other platforms work as well for me, so I am sticking with it. I purchased my Turbotax directly from Intuit, and I complained bitterly about this year's change. The Turbotax Advocate worked with me on upgrading to Premier to cushion the price shock for this year. Next year I will purchase Premier."

Over the years there have been several issues I have encountered, including the time when they were planning to limit the number of returns per software unit, or a few years ago when one of the fields on one of the forms would not allow an amount above a certain number, and of course this year with the schedule D issue. What I found was that Turbo Tax is very receptive to their customers and with a little bit of patience and conversation all my issue were resolved. The limit on e-filing went away, the field limitation was fixed in one of their updates and my personal issue with schedule D has been resolved. I encourage anyone with a specific issue to email Bob as he requests.

I took up Bob Meighan's offer to respond to individual emails for clarification. Bob, the VP of TurboTax, went above and beyond to respond quickly to my questions, and recommend the appropriate version for my situation. I am now up and running with the Home and Business version in time for year end tax planning. The installation went smoothly, and the data transfer from last year works the same as it always has. The format is very similar to prior years, and I certainly don't want to learn another software package after so many years of familiarity with TurboTax.

Please call Intuit 1-800-445-1875. Intuit will give you a free upgrade to Premier. If you already paid for the upgrade, Intuit will give you refund. After Intuit saw the revolt generated from thousands unhappy and angry customers, Intuit understands that they really taking advantage of their customers and trying to restore their name. I used Turbo Tax Deluxe since 2006 and was really upset about the sneaky way of gauging $30 from me. I just called and get the refund and feel better. I gave it a one-star at Costco review. I thought people bought the Turbo Tax Deluxe should call and get the free upgrade. I like Turbo Tax, but there are others like H&R Block Deluxe and TaxAct Deluxe to be considered next year."

A consumer should always make sure a product or service has the features or functions they need before purchasing. SO BUYERS BEWARE, this yearâs version of TT Deluxe doesnât offer all the same features as previous versions, google âTurbo Tax Deluxe 2015â to learn more. Bottom line, if you donât need to prepare a schedule C, D or E then this version will probably work fine for you. BE SURE TO SCROLL DOWN to the product description!. Kudos to Amazon for making it very clear in the product description as to what you are purchasing. In the product comparison chart it even says in BOLD ORANGE print. âSOME FEATURES ARE NOW ONLY AVAILABLE IN THESE VERSIONS OF TURBO TAXâ"

The tips the program gives you on deductions you might have missed is also a big help. The thing that sold me most on the product was the Customer Support from TurboTax. Bob Meighan, a VP at the company responded to at least 3 of my emails. This is almost unheard of in todays environment.

Homeowner like me and don't own a business and require Schedule C, this version may still work for you just fine. I have been a loyal TurboTax User for the last 10 years, and I loved the program. Because of the negative reviews, I bought the H & R Block Deluxe Version. From the reviews, it supposedly imports TurboTax Data. However, I did not find that to be true and each time I asked it to import, it came back with a message that it could not find it. I also did not like or feel comfortable with the interface.... maybe that's just me as a TB Tax user of 10 years. So, I bought the TurboTax 2014 Deluxe Version. No problem at all finding last year's Turbo Tax Data and I'm humming along seamlessly doing my taxes as always and don't need Schedule C. So yes. If you need schedule C, this version is not for you. And I gave the program 4 stars instead of 5 for this reason that Intuit took something away that was always there out of respect for all the dissatisfied loyal users.

You people are a joke and not 1 in 10 is going to H&R Blocks software next year. Now for the review. I've tried around 4 different tax prep softwares since the mid 90's. I settled on TT and have been using it for 15 years. It gets better and better. They allow you to create multiple returns and convert them to PDF's. The feature that lets you work on sections yourself instead of using the guide is great. It used to be if you resumed working on your return at a different time you had to click through pages and pages of interview. BTW in 15 years I've never had an error in a return that was caused by TT and I've prepared hundreds. Can't say enough great things about this product."

And hello TurboTax. A great thank you to the developers of this excellent software that even costs less than H&R Block (from my experience by the way). I wish I can give these guys a contribution or tip, or rather six or seven stars out of this review, because my added piece of mind is no longer with any tax preparation place, including stupid H&R Block which may be good for computer illiterate taxpayers, but no longer for me.

In previous years, the Deluxe version had minimal functionality for Schedule C, D, and E use. I sell a little stock every year, so I need this functionality. For 2014, that functionality was removed from their Deductions & Homeowners/Deluxe version - the equivalent to Deluxe in years past. To verify that I would have to spend over twice as much on the Investments & Rental Property/Premier version, I called their customer support, 800-445-1875. I spoke with a wonderful representative named John, who confirmed I would need the Premier version. He then offered to send me a free version of the Premier software. For this, I can't be more satisfied. Thank you, Intuit."

They need to be more explicit concerning the necessity of specific versions i.e Deluxe versus Premier"
7920,R1LT2JN2DOXQ8N,"Keep a perspective!","I am sure that all of this (see other posts) controversy has been instructive to Intuit. They have removed functionality before to improve profitability, but I do not remember this level of push back. Also, I am sure that Intuit's business decision will become a case study at the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management and other MBA programs around the country. Realistically the cost difference between the Deluxe and Premium versions is about $30. I am a long time Turbotax user, and I find the products to be excellent. I have not used H & R Block's software, but I cannot believe it, or any other software, is better than TT. All of my depreciation schedules are held in TT as well as my assets. I will not punish myself by changing software and, perhaps, needing to re-enter data. Intuit is working to accommodate its long time customers and so it is doing its best to remedy what was a bad marketing decision. I have purchased TT for Business as I do every year for my corporation and fiduciary tax returns. The 2014 versions of TT Premier and TT for Business have flawlessly transferred my data from last year and I will move ahead with my work."

Instead of clicking on the link for the upgrade, I telephoned Intuit customer service at the 800-445-1875 per VP Bob Meighan's advice on Amazon in response to many one star review comments. I advised that I had purchased the software as a returning customer from past years and was disappointed that this year's Deluxe version did not perform similar to the previous versions as expected. I also complained about Intuit's poor marketing of TurboTax Deluxe this year and the disabling of key functions which was totally unexpected. The agent agreed and said he would fix the problem for me. The agent walked me through the steps to upgrade to the TurboTax Deluxe Personal and Small Business software online at no extra charge. I was then able to enjoy the same functionality I always had in past years and completed Schedule C with no problems. I agree that it was an extra hassle for me to call customer service but because Intuit fixed the problem with no grief from them I gave them five stars. They would have received one star had they not fixed the problem for me. I'm just glad I didn't find this out on April 14th."

Next year we'll see what the price is and how it compares to competitors but they kept me as a customer, and I think they have a premium product which I am willing to pay a premium for.

7974,RFZVPCP1B2T1X,"Changes don't affect all Deluxe users...still a great homeowner option","Been using TurboTax for years now, and yes they did change some features this year. If you are a small business or independent contractor...you've been gifted years of functionality with this deluxe version that shouldn't have been available in my opinion. If you are running a business, you should have bought the business edition. Deluxe should be (and now is) for homeowners that are going to have more than just the standard 1040EZ filing. Boo hoo...you have to pay more to get your taxes done. $100 instead of $50, big increase. How about everyone try and see how much it would cost to have an accountant prepare your taxes for you...you'd be begging for a $100 option. Homeowners, do not be scared off by the bad reviews. This is still the same product you've been using. The changes don't affect the functionality you have been using for years now."
